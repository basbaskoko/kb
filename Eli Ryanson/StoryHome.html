                <p>
                    Dude, today literally sucked. Like, it was so bad that I actually started a journal
                    about it. Seriously. I’m writing down my thoughts to myself. Like, this is crazy, 
                    right? I’m actually talking to myself. Great, now I’m asking myself questions! Ugh!
                    Whatever. So, anyways. I was just at school, right. Chilling, minding my own 
                    business and stuff, when my girlfriend comes up to me. “Hey, Eli. Can we talk?” 
                    I know, “Seriously? Your girlfriend asked you to talk and you didn’t see this 
                    coming?” Well, yeah. I know, I’m dumb. Okay so I’m like, “Sure,” and I gesture for
                    her to like sit down and stuff, and she just goes, “In private…” In this faint, 
                    like mysterious way, and I’m just getting up like, “Yes yes yes, oh YES!” you know, 
                    thinking about what she wants privacy for. So we walk over to this closet somewhere 
                    in the gym, and I’m just like getting ready and all that. Then she goes, “I wanna 
                    talk inside.” Yeah, seriously. I mean, what would you think after that. I wanna talk
                    inside? and I’m like, “Totally, yeah. Let’s talk inside.” So we walk into the closet,
                    and I’m like holding my penis down, you know. Like trying not to make my erection too
                    obvious, and I look her in the eyes and she says, “Eli?” and I’m like “yes?” and 
                    she says it, “I’m done, we’re done. I didn’t want to embarrass you and all, but 
                    we’re done. Sorry.” And I just stood there like. AH! It was dumb, she was dumb. 
                    So anyway, that’s Julie. Just, ah. Dude, it’s already like eleven. What am I even 
                    doing? Ok, just like, “Oh, your girlfriend broke up with you? So what?” Ok, but 
                    that’s not all. I came back home, you know, just wanting to sit in my room and die.
                    Just like, for a few minutes, you know. I was just going to sit there and die for 
                    while. But when I walk into the house, the first thing I hear is, “Hey, Eli. Sup
                    man?” Yeah, he was annoying as he sounded. Stupid Uncle Ryan. Ugh, I really hate that 
                    guy. I can’t believe Grandma could produce that. Like, how does someone so, like, 
                    normal give birth to such an ogre? So I’m just standing there like, “Ryan, no really, 
                    I thought you were dead? Oh well I’ll just keep dreaming.” Only apparently I wasn’t 
                    just thinking. “Ugh, Eli, how dare you! App-” Dude, I can still hear mom’s voice, it’s 
                    hilarious. Like, “Ah, ah, Eli ooh!” and all that stuff. So now I’m just staring at 
                    them. My mom, dad, and the ogre standing before me. Ugh, I can hear it now, “Eli, 
                    Eli, why do you hate your uncle? I mean, come on.” Yeah, well, you haven’t met him, 
                    and even if you did, you wouldn’t understand. He’s great, ok. He’s just great. 
                    Wherever he is, it’s a party, everything’s awesome. It’ll be like the most boring 
                    day, you’ll just be walking, life’ll be all normal and whatever, then he shows up 
                    and BAM. It’s just great. People’ll start laughing and talking and junk, you’d think 
                    someone had just promised them the lottery jackpot. Whatever, it was dumb, he was dumb. 
                    So anyway, that idiot just walks in unannounced, just like whatever, and I’m just 
                    standing there, my mom is acting super annoyed, and my dad -- boy, you should’ve 
                    seen him -- my dad was livid. You’d think he was gay for his brother or something. 
                    He’d already taken off his belt and was walking over to me. Almost like instinctively. 
                    Like, “Oh, Eli said something? Time for a beating.” Ugh, sometimes I just want my dad 
                    to disappear. Just like, for a week or something. Nothing bad, I still love him and 
                    all, but just one peaceful week  without the whole, “Be a man! Wake up on time! 
                    Study harder! Do more better!” and all that garbage. So anyway, my dad’s walking 
                    towards me with his belt in his hand, like all ready to strangle me with it, and 
                    I’m just standing there thinking. “Do I run? I know it’ll  hurt more when he catches 
                    me, but what if he doesn’t? I--” Then I couldn’t think. My back was inflamed, and 
                    even after all the garbage that happened today, I can still feel it. In a way, it’s 
                    kind of comforting. It keeps me aware that my back still exists. I know, “uhh uhh uhh,
                    DAHH DAHH DAHH Eli, you can’t feel your back?” No but like, it’s like continuously 
                    tingling. Like, ugh, it’s just good to know it’s there. So anyway, my dad hits me, 
                    and Ryan’s still laughing his nuts off, and he looks me in the eyes and all he says is 
                    like, “It’s okay Pete, I’ll take care of him.” Oh, yeah, he’ll take care of me. Just 
                    like Julie took care of me. Just like my parents are taking care of me. Yeah, right, 
                    everyone’ll take care of me! So I walk outside with him, thinking like, “When we get 
                    out alone, I can just sorta like castrate him or something. Maybe I’ll just twist his 
                    testicles so hard that they’ll fall off, that’ll show him.” I don’t even know anymore. 
                    I guess this hatred seems kinda unwarranted, but like, ugh! It was just when I was like 
                    ten or something. I know, I know, “You want to castrate him after six years? DAHHH!” 
                    Okay but just like, hear me out. I’m just sitting there around Christmas time, and Uncle 
                    Ryan’s supposed to be coming around for the holidays, and I’m like, “Ryry, ooh, I love 
                    him.” Yeah, ten year old me. I would just grab onto his neck, and he would run me around 
                    silly. I think he actually lost like twenty pounds or something just running me around 
                    silly, it was great. Then, just one day, he stopped. Christmas day we were running around, 
                    having the time of our lives, then the next day, just, “no.” “Ryan I want to-” “No.” 
                    “But Ryry-” “No.” Everything just became “no,” and whenever I tried to talk to him, just 
                    “no.” I didn’t understand, and I still don’t, and tbh, I never want to, because like, how 
                    could he? So anyway, I’m just walking there with Ryan. Going out the house to his car, 
                    and he’s like all serious and stuff, and I’m just wondering, “What happened to Ryry? 
                    Where’s my friend?” So we get to the car and he opens the door for me. I just stare at 
                    him like, “Huh?” you know? Like, what does he want me to get in the car? It’s not like 
                    anyone else was out. So I get in the car, thinking he might just be like about to abduct 
                    me or something (yeah, keep your comments to yourself), and he gets in and sits across 
                    from me, and that’s it. We just stare at each other for way too long. And he’s just looking 
                    at me, and he goes, “Eli, I-” Only the second he said that, I cut him off. “Sorry, yeah 
                    right. Oh, I’m sorry for completely disappearing and pretending like you didn’t exist. 
                    I’m sorry for giving you life-long trust issues. I’m sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, 
                    well I’m sorry. Just, go die.” Yeah yeah, all that stuff, and he’s just looking at me 
                    the entire time, like not even moving or reacting in any way, and he just looks at me 
                    and is like, “I’m sorry about Julie.” Sorry about Julie, SORRY ABOUT JULIE! Of all the 
                    things he should be sorry about. Of everything he’s done. He’s sorry about Julie?! Yeah, 
                    so that’s when I lost it, “Go kill youself man! You disappear for my entire life. You 
                    make a mockery of my very existence, and all you have to say is ‘Sorry about Julie?!’ 
                    No, you don’t even get to care about her, and most definitely not about me!” It’s a good 
                    thing that no one else was out, because I’m sure I would’ve raised a noise complaint. 
                    And still, he just looks at me, stares me dead in the eyes. Then it got weird, really weird. 
                    I was looking in his eyes. His soft, brown eyes, perfectly complementing his warm tan face,
                    with his messed up hair spiking up in just the right directions, when his eyes weren’t brown. 
                    I stared at him, and his irises disappeared, his pupils widened. His tan skin turned a dark 
                    black, and it stretched, hanging loosely from a wiry frame. Two polished black talons appeared
                    behind his head, the light cleaning them just enough to make them shimmer. I looked at his 
                    pearly white teeth, and saw my own reflection staring back at me. Only then did I realize the 
                    magnitude of my fear. My once composed figure was a mess. Sweat had found its way all over my 
                    skin. My joints had been lubricated with the fear of what stood before me. Then he spoke, 
                    “Eli, I left you, I’m sorry.” I stared at him, waiting for more, and I heard his voice, 
                    “Guess who’s your favorite demon?” I looked at the face before me, paralized staring at the 
                    unwavering lips. “Me, I thought that was apparent when I transcended right now.” I tried to 
                    speak, flailing my lips back and forth, opening and closing my mouth, but no words came out. 
                    “Or should I think you?” His voice resounded in my mind, but I knew that my ears hadn’t heard 
                    them. “Ryan, what?” I managed a coherent thought. I still remember his thoughts, his voice 
                    resounding in my mind, he started showing me images. First of myself. I say myself running and 
                    playing, singing and dancing. I saw myself the happiest I’d ever been. It didn’t take a while 
                    for me to know that was before all this happened. Then I was staring in a mirror, and I saw Ryan. 
                    His smile comforted me. I allowed it to, but then it changed, and the demon standing before me was 
                    anything but comforting. I say the ground below me, only I had never done this. Writing this now, 
                    I realize Ryan was showing me his thoughts, and it all changed. I understood, I understood more than 
                    I ever had, not just Ryan, but everything. As I flew throughout a barren, burning landscape, I saw 
                    particles before me. I knew exactly how to turn my wings to fly. I knew my velocity at each instant 
                    in time, and the sum of my mechanical energy. I knew everything. I was everything. Then I wasn’t. 
                    I was staring back at Uncle Ryan. We were back in the car. “Ryan, what-” “I told you, I am a demon.” 
                    Yeah, you could imagine the questions, but I didn’t have any. I just knew. I was a demon, same as him. 
                    He was about to die, and I was his only living blood relative. He had come to activate me, and he’d 
                    stayed back for so long to give me a normal life. He’d sacrifice himself for me. So anyway, that 
                    happened today. I’m a demon, Uncle Ryan was just trying to help me, and Julie, well, she can go 
                    love herself. I mean, come one, I could literally tear her apart if I wanted to, but my only regret 
                    now, I hated Ryan. Not the way I treated him, but I really hated him. He was a demon and I hated 
                    him. Well, there isn’t anything I can do for him now. After he showed me the whole story of his life, 
                    I realized that we demons seem to have a shortened life expectancy. I’m the last of my blood line 
                    when it comes to crazy dragon people. Ryan died in the car right after he saw me transform. The 
                    funny thing about us, apparently we just sort of burn up in black flames when we pass. Yep, we just 
                    cease to exist. Ahh, there’s so much I can do, I honestly can’t wait. I guess I’ll go flying around 
                    town tomorrow, but until then I should stop writing and get to bed.

                <p>
                    Hey! I found my old journal! Ah, I remember writing this. I remember that day. Man, 
                    it’s hard to believe it’s already been ten years. Yeah I guess I’ll pick up where I 
                    ended last. So Julie left me and I found my demon powers. After that I just sort of 
                    went on. Life didn’t like change or anything. This all happened around my junior or 
                    senior year of high school, I don’t really remember which one. So after I discovered 
                    powers and all, I think about a month or so later, Ryan died. I knew before everyone 
                    else of course (you know, because I’m a demon), but it was still pretty heartbreaking, 
                    knowing that I’d missed out on such a friendship and all. It wasn’t all bad though. I 
                    managed to keep a telepathic relationship with him after I’d discovered my powers. He’d 
                    gone off back to this underground cave place (at least I think that’s what it was), and 
                    just sort of lived there until he died. I saw him every day that month. I remember it 
                    vividly. I’d come home from school -- physics and calculus were a breeze due to the fact 
                    that I was able to calculate all my vectors and stuff mid flight (there’s a bunch of 
                    aerodynamics when flying: wing angle, body position, center of mass. It’s crazy, I was 
                    like a supercomputer)  --  which left me with like no homework and all the time to keep 
                    eyes on Ryan. He still lived his normal life, being an engineer and all, but every night 
                    he’d run off to his cave somewhere. He’d have his paycheck shipped directly to an orphanage 
                    since he didn’t need to pay bills or anything. Actually, I don’t think any mortal even knew 
                    he existed. He just worked all day like normal, flew to some remote mountains like five 
                    hundred miles away, caught some deer for dinner, slept and repeated. Man, what a life. 
                    Personally though, I chose a different life. At the current moment, I just sort of secretly 
                    exist. I mean, not like Uncle Ryan, but kind of. Everyone knows who I am, and I’m kind of a 
                    hot shot these days. I was just walking home from school one day, rolling down the streets 
                    of Cali, when I met Sophia. I guess I didn’t technically meet her then (we’d worked together 
                    a bit at Stanford), but that was when I’d really met her. I’d just finished a paper on the 
                    importance of rotational kinetic energy for flight stability concerning small dense objects 
                    (yeah, don’t ask me how I knew that one), and was waiting for my top mark, and thanks to her 
                    I’m still waiting. Professor said my paper was too safe, and that he’d seen it hundreds of 
                    times (ironically by me), and he was much more interested in the paper detailing the 
                    rotational patterns of asteroids as they enter the earth’s atmosphere. As you’d probably 
                    imagine, I didn’t take up a liking to her right away. That didn’t last though. After about 
                    two intense multivariable calculus showdowns, we found to be better compliments than sine 
                    and its derivative. We dated for a while -- I can’t really remember how long -- and just 
                    after that we got married. I think I showed her the demon right before I proposed. Actually 
                    that might’ve been how I proposed. It was great I think. Honestly all I remember from that 
                    day was taking her flying above the forest. I remember that part like it just happened. 
                    We’d been dating for about a year, and I was all ready. I’d swam down to the bottom of the 
                    ocean to find the biggest, shiniest pearls on the west coast, and traded them with some 
                    jeweler for a four carat diamond. I know I got ripped off, but who cares. The proposal was 
                    great. I’d just taken her some cliche romantic comedy at the cinema and we were looking for 
                    a place to eat. I got on my motorcycle, still nervous about what was about to happen, and 
                    we took off. I’d told her that we were going to some fancy outdoor grill just outside the 
                    city limits (I alway surprised her stuff like that), when we “accidentally” got lost on some 
                    mountain road. The scene was perfect: the forest was to our right, shining a vibrant green 
                    from the summer sun, a soft breeze was coming from over the ocean on our left, sweeping her 
                    amber hair about, and radiating her glowing complexion. I acted like I needed to go use the 
                    restroom on some tree, wandered about around the trees for some minutes, then came right up 
                    behind where she was standing only to “slip.”

                    “Ah!” I grunted like I’d twisted my and fell on my face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli!” I could tell from the laugh she was holding back that she didn’t buy it for 
                    a penny, but I still knelt there on the ground, waiting, groaning (although 
                    admittedly very forcibly). “All right, get up. I don’t want to stand out here 
                    forever.” But I wouldn’t get up, and I don’t think I’ve ever made a better choice 
                    in my life. “Eli, really, don’t make me come down there.” But I still waited, 
                    motionless, grasping the diamond in my hand. “Eli I-” Her sigh told me she knew 
                    she was walking down to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember it vividly. I knelt there, holding the ring in my hand, and she slowly 
                    crawled down to me. I knew what was coming for me, and I was ready. She playfully 
                    grabbed my hair and pulled my head up. “Eli I-” I pulled out the ring and she froze. 
                    We stared at each other for what felt like eternity, but not long enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, I-” our embrace cut me off before I could even say it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s about as much as I remember. I think we rode home after that, but I don’t 
                    know exactly what happened. The wedding was shortly after that, and now here we are. 
                    It’s hard to believe we’ve been married for almost three years (but not that hard, 
                    considering they’ve been the best three years of my life), and here we are. Sophia 
                    and I found work out here in Palmdale with Lockheed Martin. I haven’t flown much 
                    since that day, but with Sohpia, who really needs flight anyway? That’s it I guess. 
                    Hopefully this’ll be the last time I’ll ever need to update this journal (granted 
                    nothing else noteworthy happens with Sophia and I).

                <p class="date">October 8, 2015</p>
                <p>
                    It’s well past dark right now, Sophia’s asleep under an oak tree, and we’re both 
                    cold and hungry. If it wasn’t for the southern breeze blowing right now, she’d 
                    probably freeze without me. The forest provides some warmth due to the trees 
                    blocking the more intense wind, and burrowing slightly into the ground helps a 
                    lot. I should really be asleep right now, but I wanted to record this in case I 
                    don’t get a chance to write in a while. I got a message today from the demon world. 
                    I’ve always sort of known, but I just wanted to enjoy life a little longer (yeah, 
                    that’s over now). It was Friday afternoon, Sophia and I had just gotten back from 
                    work and we were watching the Shark’s first game of the season. Naturally, we 
                    weren’t paying attention to the action as much as just enjoying one another. We 
                    didn’t get to spend time together often, and these games were mostly an excuse for 
                    us to just sit with each other. She was passed out her head on my shoulder, and I 
                    had my arm around her and was just about to fall asleep when the image flashed 
                    before my eyes. I saw a dark circular cave with what seemed like hundreds of human 
                    sized bats hanging on the walls. There wasn’t much light save for a small, glowing 
                    black fire in the middle of the cave. My vision moved. I was looking up at what 
                    would’ve otherwise been the ceiling of the cave, and I saw a gaping hole, out of 
                    which black masses flew in and out, screeching and screaming as they did, demons 
                    like myself. Fire came from the hole and filled the cave, causing all traffic in 
                    or out to cease. A message was sent to all of us: that we should report to the cave 
                    immediately. Hundreds of demons flew in, all mat black, scaly skinned, screeching 
                    and laughing as they did. The cave was nearly full. People were sitting on the ground, 
                    some were hanging on the walls, and everyone else was hovering attentively in the 
                    middle of the ceiling. All of them waiting, leaving a small area untouched. Just then 
                    the fire ceased, and it’s source appeared, who I recognized immediately although I’d 
                    never seen him before, the newly crowned Krapot of the demons. As soon as he entered 
                    the room, all others froze, paralyzed with respect for their king, and they all chanted 
                    in Iaith (the language of the demons), “Yenge debe yer Konig Krapot!” Long live the King 
                    Krapot! The old Krapot was dead, but that wasn’t what worried me. What I still don’t 
                    understand was that before that moment I didn’t even know we’d had a Krapot. I still 
                    don’t know how that was possible. When I spoke to Ryan, I thought I’d learned 
                    everything. How could he not have told me this? How could I have gone so long 
                    without knowing about an entire society of others like ourselves? Anyway, I watched 
                    as the Krapot took his place in the center of the room, hovering gently a few 
                    hundred meters above the ground, and as everyone else lowered themselves below him. 
                    The Krapot’s Iaith was quick and simple, “Konig Krapot Kaiser! Icsh de eighiseen 
                    konig a uschunt yakh, jyungto, iygjwak ger huvna. Jdgama!” King Krapot Kaiser! 
                    The one hundredth king in the ancient ways, stands before you, and he hath but one 
                    mission. Revenge! With that remark he blew his fire and flew off, a roar from the 
                    crowd along with him as everyone flew back to his city. The vision passed, and there 
                    I was watching the game, Sophia still asleep on my shoulder (albeit now her drool 
                    was all over my arm), and the Sharks were losing one-zero to the Wild with ten 
                    minutes left in the third period. I shook Sophie awake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, what-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pain I felt interrupting her was incomparable. What a monster I truly was to 
                    cut off such a beautiful, radiant face, adorned with wavy amber locks. Since the day 
                    I’d met here she never ceased to be beautiful, but she was more so today. 
                    “Sophia,” I looked into her eyes, her radiant, light-brown eyes. “Sophia, you don’t 
                    deserve this, I-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, I don’t deserve this. I don’t deserve you, but since I have you, please tell 
                    me what’s wrong.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even now while she’s asleep I still can’t fully comprehend how blessed I am to have her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia,” my heart raced with what was about to happen, only allowing my words to 
                    croak out of my mouth. “They’re coming. They’re coming for you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Who’s coming?” even in death she still managed to keep her stable composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I saw them, the other demons. They have a new king, and they’re coming for you 
                    -- for people like you, for humans, and I know them. They won’t stop. They’ll kill 
                    everyone they find. They won’t stop.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even after this, her expression remained unchanged, “Why?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t know. Something happened, they have a new king I think, but other than 
                    that I don’t know.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You can’t see them?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I wondered that myself. I can’t see anything. I can’t hear anything. Before 
                    this I didn’t even know they existed. They sent a message I think. They want 
                    everyone they can get. They’re planning to come all at once or something and 
                    kill everyone. I don’t know.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn’t know, and she didn’t know what to say, but her embrace said more than I 
                    could possibly express.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kissed the soft head on my shoulder, “Sophia, I don’t know what the future
                     holds, but I need to go. I need to stop them. If they’re coming for us, to 
                     wage war against mankind, I have to stop them. They’ll listen to me. I-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, we will go. They’ll listen to you, to us.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her look shut me up before she even made a sound. “Eli Ryanson, you listen here! 
                    You are setting out on a mission to talk an army of demons out of waging war on 
                    armies of mad men, and you are completely out of you mind if you think for a single 
                    moment that-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok, ok, I’m sorry.” My mistress was cruel and harsh, but even now I’m still sure 
                    I’m doing the best for her. She’s sleeping now on the ground, blanketed by dirt 
                    and leaves, and sheltered by trees from a raging wind, waiting to walk up to an 
                    army of demons out to drive her race to extinction because of me. I wasn’t sure 
                    what to do. I wanted her with me. I wanted her here more than I could ever express. 
                    If I was going to die on this trip, there wasn’t a single other person I would’ve 
                    rather died with, but how could I let her come along. For all I know, I’ve sent us 
                    off on a suicide mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I embraced her after our brief discussion, and we took off. Honestly, if it wasn’t 
                    for the threat of life altering war, today would’ve been great. Sophia and I hadn’t 
                    flown since college, and feeling her in my arms hugging tightly to me almost made 
                    me glad for this life threatening mission. We landed just outside Ryan’s kingdom. 
                    I knew that everyone else would already know about my arrival, and some of them 
                    even tried to reach out to me, but we camped just outside the cave. I would be 
                    accepted no questions asked, but what about Sophia? I caught us a deer for dinner 
                    just before we crashed here for the night. I would’ve gone to check out the cave 
                    and everything, but I can’t just leave Sophia out here alone, not with the 
                    perpetual threat of someone coming over and shredding her to pieces. Tomorrow we’re 
                    going in to meet everyone else, but I’m not sure what to expect. In any case, 
                    this journal will help someone, somewhere know what happened to us. I guess I’ll 
                    get some rest right now, tomorrow’s a big day.
                </p>

            <div class="entry">
                <p class="date">October 9, 2015</p>
                <p>
                    Sophia’s asleep again, although this time I’m more confident in her security, 
                    and I might even get some sleep after I’m done writing this. This morning I woke 
                    up to a branch breaking right next to me. I got up and flew over to Sophia, talons 
                    out, ready for whatever was coming our way. My senses were dialed up, and I saw 
                    everything -- I knew the speed and direction of the wind, the electrical 
                    conductivity of the earth beneath me, and Sophia, sleeping peacefully behind my -- 
                    but I didn’t notice the four demons circling above us. I reached out to them, 
                    trying to hear their thoughts, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t read their minds or even 
                    locate their general positions. They all landed, each one on a different side of 
                    me. “Peace!” they yelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I transformed before them, exposing myself and Sophia to the worst. “Prove it!” 
                    My voice quavered despite my endeavor to sound confident.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where four black masses were once standing now stood four young men, each no more 
                    than thirty years old. “We’re here in peace.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why couldn’t I see you?” Writing this now I realize just how incoherent my fear had made me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Try opening your eyes.” The one on my right must’ve been the clown of the bunch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The one who’d spoken first walked towards me. Even now in his human figure he was 
                    built. His pale skin reflected the sun in every direction, but his black curly hair 
                    along with his black shirt and blue jeans helped negate the effect. “You’ll have to 
                    forgive my friend, he’s still learning to hold his tongue.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why couldn’t I see you?” my fear of those four shaking my voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Relax, we’ll explain everything.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I saw his life flash before my eyes. He was from the cave nearby, and he was 
                    fighting for the life of humans, but I couldn’t tell against who and why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m Lucas, and these are Liam, Noah, and William.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noah and William remained silent throughout the entire encounter. They looked very 
                    similar. I think they might’ve been twins. Each was moderately tall and pale. 
                    They had roundish faces and ears that stuck out of piles of curly, ginger hair, 
                    but their single defining features were their freckled faces and their matching 
                    flannel shirts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re from the cave over there where they’re planning to dominate the human race.” 
                    My thoughts betrayed my wrath to them, “Relax Elijah, we’re the resistance. 
                    We’re not here for either you or your wife.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why can’t I hear your thoughts?” this invasion of privacy was far too much on their part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noah answered me silently, <em>You will learn in time. Just be patient.</em> His voice 
                    resounded through my head, and I could tell from Sophia’s expression that I was the 
                    only one who’d heard it. Lucas invaded my brain next and taught me everything. 
                    Thoughts were simple. All I had to do was say no, as the only way into the mind is 
                    through a consenting consciousness (apparently that also means that the victim must 
                    remain conscious). I wish that were all I needed to know, as what came next was 
                    everything I’d feared. The men were part of the king’s guard who had aborted once 
                    Kaiser had taken power. They had sent the vision to everyone who was able to 
                    receive it, masking their thoughts as they did. They shielded their minds 
                    constantly and taught me to do the same. All the knowledge they possessed was 
                    passed on to me in that instant. Demons had telepathic communication, we could 
                    all read each other’s minds, but it was more than that. We could feel each other’s 
                    feelings, live each other’s lives: truly see each other, truly understand one 
                    another. They saw all of me -- my life before Ryan, my Stanford years with Sophia, 
                    everything I was -- and I saw all of them. Noah and William were twins who’d been 
                    abandoned at birth, although they later discovered that their parents had been 
                    murdered just after they were delivered, and were heart set on learning more. Liam 
                    was the son of a high ranking official of the cave who’d been executed after Kaiser 
                    had taken power. Apparently his father had taken vengeance on a peasant who, after 
                    starving for quite some time had resorted to feasting on mankind, philanthropy 
                    didn’t seem to be tolerated under the new crown. Lucas, however, was the most 
                    interesting of the bunch. He was in line to become Krapot before Kaiser, but he 
                    conceded the throne after traversing the brutal world of its responsibilities. 
                    They had all been training under the Krapot before Kaiser ascended to the throne, 
                    all of them going so far as to become the Krapot’s Karrage -- his advisory council. 
                    My vision ended and I was standing before them again, staring at the four faces 
                    before me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked at Lucas, “Kaiser’s coming for man, isn’t he?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes,” his voice was faint as he looked at Sophia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You’re masking us from his vision, he can see out minds?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes,” this time more commanding, staring me in the eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And you’re all treasonous?” my confidence and hopefulness began to manifest themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes, and you’ve been living amongst them,” he gestured towards Sophia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest I thought to them, unaware of who else may be around. 
                    <em>I’ll help you. Clearly I don’t want this anymore than you do.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By that time the sun was going down, and I could tell by Sophia’s expression 
                    that she hadn’t slept much the night before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I projected my thoughts to them all, <em>Take us to your cave. Bring us some 
                    dinner and a bed, and we’ll discuss the rest tomorrow.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I heard their voices in one accord, <em>Agreed.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all took off. I held Sophia so tightly that flight I honestly was worried I 
                    was going to kill her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We flew over the forest for kilometers. Speeding past Ryan’s kingdom and to what 
                    seemed like an abandoned coal mine. As we landed I looked inside. The tunnel was 
                    dark. Rusted tracks were laid on splintered wood, and the smell of stale water and 
                    rust filled the air, making breathing almost painful. We followed them in. Sophia 
                    was clinging to me and my arms were around her. I knew she was scared, but what 
                    worried me the most was my own fear. We ventured on down the dark tunnel until a 
                    light appeared before us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re almost there,” Liam’s voice resounded throughout the tunnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Really, no thanks, captain obvious.” I could tell by his scoff that he was 
                    beginning to take a liking to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The light grew brighter and brighter as we walked along. The tracks slowly became 
                    visible again. Then I could make out imperfections in the cave wall, and soon I 
                    could even see the amber strands of Sophia’s hair. We’d reached the end of the 
                    tunnel and stood out on a cliff. I looked out at the vast city before me. Buildings 
                    were carved out of what seemed to be filtered obsidian. Demons flew from ledge to 
                    ledge, screeching and screaming the whole way. I saw bands of smaller demons flying 
                    at the highest point of the cave, well above any buildings. On the roofs of the city 
                    I saw a ball of black fire flying through the air. I followed its trajectory to its 
                    target and observed as a young black mass caught it. It was only then that I 
                    realized there wasn’t any light in the cave. Everything was illuminated by the 
                    black fire whose presence at the roof of the cave seemed to be perpetual. Finally 
                    we landed on a ledge at the mouth of a cave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>You two should stay here today. Tomorrow I’ll come explain everything.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Thanks.</em> The best part about this new telepathy was that I didn’t just say 
                    thanks, I’d meant it. I could transmit my feelings of gratitude to the four and not 
                    need to waste my time with words. They flew off as we entered the cave. It’s pretty 
                    cozy down here. I’m sitting on a sequoioideae desk illuminated by a black fire 
                    hovering steadily above me. It can’t possibly be past three in the afternoon, but 
                    the lack of sunlight here means that doesn’t really matter. I haven’t slept in 
                    hours, but after everything I’ve seen down here I don’t think I have anything to 
                    worry about with Sophia. I should get some sleep right now. Tomorrow we negotiate 
                    the fate of humanity with Kaiser.

                <p class="date">October 10, 2015</p>
                <p>
                    It’s about two in the morning right now. Sophia and Lucas are asleep. It’s 
                    technically my turn to join them, but I wanted to write everything down while I 
                    still have the chance. Noah, Liam, and William are keeping guard. I offered to 
                    relive someone, but they were all to anexious to get some rest since we’re 
                    officially on a suicide mission. That doesn’t really bother me so much as the fact 
                    that I dragged Sophia into this. I can’t believe I said yes. It was so simple. When 
                    she asked all I had to do was say no. Honestly, I wanted her here with me. I always 
                    thought that if I was going to die, I wanted to die with her, but now that I get to 
                    make good on that promise I’m starting to feel remorse. I’m probably overthinking 
                    this. Anyway, this morning we spoke to Kaiser. We’d just woken up at what I assume 
                    was a reasonable time in the morning. I thought out to Lucas, Noah, and William.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hey guys, are we really doing this?</em> I sent them my unease considering 
                    Sophia was joining us. It was dark, and she was still asleep. I wasn’t sure if it 
                    was safer for her to come with us or stay in the cave. The cave provided enough 
                    shelter from everyone else that if something happened she could be safely hidden, 
                    but I just couldn’t leave her. What if something had happened to her (more than 
                    already has)? That would’ve been entirely my fault. I shook her awake. I wasn’t sure 
                    what time it was, but considering everyone else was still asleep I safely assumed 
                    it was around two or three in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>We’re all ready. Meet us outside your cave in five.</em> Their voices resounded 
                    in my mind in a perfect harmony. It’s nice having their company. I’d always had 
                    Sophia, but they were different. We were connected. Not nearly as much as Sophia 
                    and I, but we could express emotions without words. We could feel each others’ 
                    feelings. It’s just different. I went over to Sophia to shake her awake. I was 
                    almost too nervous. With her delicate frame lying peacefully in bed it almost 
                    seemed wrong to awake such a beauty. I let my hand hover just above her shoulder, 
                    pondering my options, when I heard her voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You’re not going to wake me up, are you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, I,” I was stuttering a bit at that point. “I just-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, I’ll be fine. Kaiser will listen. Everything’ll be fine.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, what if you get hurt? Or-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli,” she started to express her annoyance at my constant worrying. “Are you 
                    going to let anything happen to me?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, but-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Are you going to stand idly by and watch me die?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, don’t-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Then we have nothing to worry about.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even with the supercomputer in my head, it was hard to argue with her, but the 
                    look I was giving her told her I still wasn’t on board with her presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Besides,” the sarcasm had left her voice now, “You need me. You want to argue 
                    the fate of humanity without man?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sighed louder than I remember sighing in a long while. “Just stay close to me, please.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her warm embrace was all the assurance I needed. “Wouldn’t be anywhere else for the world.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Um, hey dimwit. Sorry to ruin the moment, but the fate of humanity is still kinda 
                    at stake here.</em> If we weren’t out here in the middle of nowhere I would totally give 
                    Liam the beating of his life. I sent him my confusion upon hearing his thoughts only 
                    to be bombarded with the course of action. Noah, William, Lucas, and Liam had 
                    prepared a distraction. After which Sophia and I were supposed to make our way to 
                    Kaiser. I’m still amazed at what those four can pull off. They all flew away without 
                    another word, leaving Sophia and me alone on the ledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Did they do the mind thing and say-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sat there, wondering what they might’ve been planning, when we saw them. 
                    They were each holding black flames in their hands, throwing them at the children. 
                    I reached out to Lucas and saw nothing but pure joy. I was flying high above every 
                    school class in the cave carelessly lobbing fire upon small winged foes. I was 
                    beginning to feel empathy for the kids until I felt them. The sheer magnitude of 
                    their pleasure was ludicrous. They were laughing as though being tickled by the 
                    fire, which in fact didn’t burn them, or even cause any discomfort. I reached 
                    around, feeling every emotion around me, and broke out into laughter. Sophia 
                    might’ve been looking at me by that point, but I didn’t care. All I felt was joy. 
                    The joy of my friends, soaring above the city, hurling balls of fire down below 
                    them, and the joy of the children running around, trying to catch the black orbs. 
                    I looked over to Sophia, “I think that’s our que.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew my wings, and she held tight to my bosom. It had only been a day since we’d 
                    flown together, but once we held on to each other I felt as though I’d just found 
                    something I was missing my entire life. I took off, flying high above the mayhem 
                    below us. I looked down below us as we flew, enjoying the scene, when I realized 
                    that I didn’t know exactly where Kaiser was. I thought out to Lucas, but before I 
                    even had the chance to think I heard his voice. <em>Fly up through the passage in the 
                    ceiling. He’ll be there.</em> I took off straight up and scanned the cave’s roof. Just 
                    above some obsidian structures, where some school-aged teenagers seemed to be 
                    enjoying the chaos, was a small opening. As I noticed it, I realized that everyone 
                    else did too, yet it seemed to clear everything within some distance of itself. 
                    I looked down at Sophia in my arms. She looked as  confident as ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ready?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli,” I could discern her answer from the sarcasm in her voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We flew up into the whole, ready for Kaiser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cave was dark. I looked around, straining my eyes for anything: any light, 
                    any sound, any way to grasp my surroundings. I heard a stomp sound to my left 
                    and held Sophia tighter around me. I shouldn’t’ve let her come. How could I? 
                    How could I have said “yes?” I expressed my unease to the mysterious figure beside 
                    me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Relax man. We’re in this together.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas’s voice granted rest to my unease, if only momentarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>That you are.</em> His voice was cold, expressionless, monotonous. I reached out, 
                    eager to feel feelings, to emphasize with a demon, but all I felt was a harsh 
                    wind in my face, and a chill rushed down my spine. Scarcely able to make out his 
                    features in the dark, I looked over at Lucas, who’s face confirmed that I was the 
                    only one who’d felt it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ugh! Cut the act and show yourself!” That was the first time I’d rather have not 
                    heard Sophia’s voice. Even in the face of her direct antithesis she still kept her 
                    composure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kaiser’s confusion met Lucas and I. <em>Why can’t I feel her?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    White fire erupted around the corners of the room and illuminated our surroundings. 
                    Kaiser sat before us on a pearly white throne, contrasting the obsidian chamber we 
                    were in. His throne room wasn’t more than five-hundred cubic meters, made of pure 
                    obsidian that reflected every light back distorted and darker that it was. The 
                    room was bare, save for Kaiser’s throne made of pure white marble, adorned with 
                    polished bones, seemingly from something bigger than was known to man. Kaiser 
                    himself sat on the throne. He was bigger than anyone I’d ever seen. His jet balck 
                    skin clung tightly to his lean figure, revealing bulging muscles continually 
                    contorting themselves in various manners. His talons were the purest black, not a 
                    speck of grey lie in them, and his hair lay in a blakc nest atop his head, out of 
                    which obsidian horns protruded. I didn’t remember seeing him like that in my vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ah,” his voice was deep, but smooth, almost soothing. “She’s not one of us.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrapped my wings around Sophia and I, ready for whatever he might do. “Relax, Eli.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How do you know my name?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas and I looked directly at Kaiser, anticipating the coming bloodshed, 
                    but Kaiser remained seated on his throne, and almost looked irritated by that 
                    point. Then he looked up, lifting his head towards the ceiling, and blew a white 
                    burst of fire. I turned my back towards the flames, hoping to keep Sophia safe 
                    from the immense heat. I sensed her discomfort from the way she writhed around 
                    in my arms, although I knew by the way she pressed herself to me that she didn’t 
                    want to be released. Suddenly the heat stopped, I let go of Sophia and looked 
                    around at Kaiser. “What do I have to do to get an answer from you?” Kaiser’s 
                    annoyance was clearly portrayed in his exclamatory groan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia spoke first, “What do you want with us?” Her voice echoed throughout the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kaiser waited, looking off for a moment, then answered. “With you, nothing. 
                    What I want, what I really want is one thing-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah yeah, revenge and all that, but what do you really want? What’s wrong with you? What-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Would you just shut up for one-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas and I took the opportunity. Sophia did it. I still can’t believe that she’d 
                    done it. Kaiser relieved himself from his mental guard. Lucas and I swarmed on him, 
                    our wills stronger than his. I looked into his mind. I saw his thoughts. I felt his 
                    feelings. I was a small boy, no more than eight, playing alone on a swing set. 
                    Other kids were running around, playing some tag game. I was determined to say 
                    alone, swaying back and forth, although I didn’t know why. A boy walked up to me 
                    and touched me on the arm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Tag, you’re it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was excited. I had never known anything like this before. I ran around the 
                    playground, eager to find someone to touch. I saw a small girl, she seemed to be 
                    about my age, and extended my arm to her. “Tag, you’re it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She looked at me and smiled, and my heart stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was an older man now, probably around my thirties. I was walking through a 
                    corridor, carrying groceries in my arms. I was troubled, though. On my way to 
                    the grocery store I’d seen a man in trouble, surrounded by big men holding bats 
                    on all sides. We were all standing in an alley between two tall buildings. I 
                    unfolded my wings and flew off. I hadn’t hurt the thieves, but I’d scared them 
                    just enough to save the man. I hid my demon and extended my arm to the man. He 
                    looked me in the eyes, “Get away from me you creep! I think I’d rather have been 
                    killed by those thugs.” I watched as his bald, muscular image scurried off away 
                    from me. I recovered my groceries and proceeded on my way. I was just opening the 
                    door, playing back the scene in my mind, and I saw my wife in the arms of another. 
                    He was tall and muscular, passionately embraced with my lover. I lost it. I flew 
                    into him as fast as I could. I looked back at my wife, and at her feet I saw a 
                    pair of legs, who’s torso was resting just behind me. She came to console me. I 
                    was hesitant at first, but I grudgingly complied with her request. I hugged her, 
                    but then I saw him. I couldn’t take it. I unfolded my wings and tore my arms away. 
                    I looked around my apartment. At my feet lay the beautiful head I’d loved so much, 
                    and at the door lay the body to which it belonged. I couldn’t take it. I flew off, 
                    right out my window. I flew off and vowed never to return. I found a cave and made 
                    myself ready. Ready to die and never return. I slumbered, only to be awakened by a 
                    prodding on my wings. I looked around and saw men around me, ready, longing for my 
                    destruction. I couldn’t take it. My vision turned red, and I let go. I let 
                    everything go: all that’d been in me since my youth, I let it go. When I was done 
                    the cave was deep red. Men were strewn everywhere. I took off, vowing to recompense 
                    those men with everything they’d done to me. I wandered into a cave and found others 
                    like myself. They taught me, and I learned everything from them. I looked about the 
                    walls of my enclosure and found something to aid my quest, and vile, small yet 
                    powerful. I stole it away from the shelf on which it lay, and later, when I was 
                    alone, I drank it. My vision turned black, and I saw everything. Every demon was 
                    outlined in pure silver. Each of their thoughts and emotions passed through me. I 
                    looked around and found one other like me, one other who possessed such immense 
                    power: Krappot Kanig. I knew that he could see everything. I knew that he saw my 
                    new-found power. His voice boomed in my ears, <em>You will be next.</em> I saw everything. 
                    My senses were heightened more than they’d ever been. My strength had been multiplied 
                    past all others. My mind ran more computations than was ever previously thought 
                    possible. I looked around. That was the only vile left. I was the only one like me. 
                    I rested for the time, waiting, knowing that one day vengeance would come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was holding Sophia again. Kaiser was sitting before me, livid as ever. I thought
                    out to Noah, William, Lucas, and Liam. <em>Playtime’s over. We’re getting out of here.</em> 
                    Lucas and I took off. We flew down out of the throne room. I thought back to Kaiser,
                    he was summoning everyone onto us. I hid my thoughts and told everyone to do the 
                    same. We didn’t have any plans to die. I flew out over the chaos. The city below 
                    us was burning. Demons were flying back and forth trying to reinstate order. Black 
                    fire clung to dark obsidian. Children were joyfully throwing fire on everything 
                    they saw. It had been nearly an hour since Noah, William, and Liam had started the 
                    mayhem. We all gathered at the tunnel’s mouth and flew off. As we flew I filled 
                    them in on everything. On Kaiser’s revenge, and the vile. We hid our thoughts and 
                    made it outside the mine. It was raining when we got outside, causing green to 
                    glisten off the grass and trees. I turned around and looked back at the mine. 
                    From the outside, you wouldn’t’ve been able to tell that anything was happening. 
                    All the noise, the sharp screeching, the playful screaming, the black inferno 
                    reducing everything in the cave to dust, was gone. All that remained was a small 
                    dirt hill with a miniscule, square-shaped hole framed with rotting wood. Had I 
                    not met Lucas, Noah, William, and Liam, I wouldn’t have supposed it could’ve 
                    supported life, nonetheless an entire society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We have to go.” I knew Kaiser would be after us. I turned to look at the others. 
                    Sophia still hadn’t left her place by my side. She grabbed on to me, and before we 
                    knew where we were going, we took off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I flew through the air with Sophia, the green forest below us, and the wind 
                    blowing in our faces. She looked up at me and smiled. Even on a flight to our 
                    deaths we managed to have the best times together. Lucas descended first, and 
                    the rest of us followed. We landed outside a small cave, barely large enough 
                    for the six of us to lay a meter apart. Lucas spoke out loud granted Sophia was 
                    with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We can’t stay sentient for very long. What’s the plan?” Everyone was staring at me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked at Sophia considering that was typically her que.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” The face she made was one I’d never seen before. For the first time 
                    since I’d met her, she honestly didn’t have a plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Kaiser is a Grozov.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” Noah, William, and Liam all joined Sophia that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “A Grozov,” Lucas interjected, “is someone like us, but not. Back before the two 
                    realms converged, and the demons met the humans, the Grozov ruled everything. 
                    He would come to us as Krappot, immensely powerful amongst us. Able to see everyone 
                    and everything at once. He could process extreme amounts of information without 
                    ever directing a full thought. He learned abilities formerly thought impossible. 
                    He managed to summon fire from nothing, and vaporize at will.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia burst into laughter when he said that. “Oh, he’ll disappear into thin air. Ahh, so scary.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas looked sterner than I’d ever seen him. “And he ruled amongst the humans. Remember Carthage?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia seemed taken aback when he said this. “Enlighten me.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He looked dead into her eyes. Expressionless, emotionless. “One hundred fifty 
                    thousand dead. Their blood flooded streets. Children watched as mothers were 
                    ripped apart head from body. Men were left torn in two, their intestines strewn 
                    about cities. Babes who managed to escape were ultimately captured and competed 
                    for their lives against one another. Ultimately to perish and used for nourishment. 
                    Some were kept alive, about three hundred men and three hundred women, sustained 
                    by the body and blood of their offspring, for the sole purpose of the continuation 
                    of the kingdom. It was the Grozov. The first Grozov, Krappot Varnam, managed the 
                    destruction of an entire nation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And Kaiser’s no different,” Sophia concluded for him. The look Lucas gave me 
                    told me he was over her impatient attitude. I sat down on the cold stone floor of 
                    the cave. Silence proceeded the quick banter. We all stared at each other for a 
                    few minutes. Nobody talked. Sophia looked up at me, then back towards Lucas, and 
                    back at the ground again. “So what are we going to do?” Her soft voice broke the 
                    silence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noah, William, and Liam both looked up at Lucas and I. I thought over to Lucas, <em>How-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I could even think his voice interrupted my thoughts. “The stava.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” Everyone's voice echoed in unison. Sophia gave me that look telling me 
                    she had no idea what was going on. Honestly, even if we don’t come out of this 
                    alive, at least I’ll have gotten to see sides of her I never knew existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “After ruling nations for countless decades, Krappot Varnam wearied of his endless 
                    tyranny. He tried everything to kill himself. He fell from heights, flew defenseless 
                    into battles, once he was even said to have impaled himself. After years of toiling to 
                    destroy his body, he realized that he had to be killed. He took a vile of his blood 
                    and forced it into a child. Krappot Getsemani. He rose up and killed him with the 
                    swipe of his hand.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And the cycle’s continued. One of these creeps gets power hungry then decides to 
                    kill himself.” Lucas seemed to be ignoring her. “Getsemani cursed the vile. 
                    It traverses the globe seemingly randomly, always full. He intended it as a way 
                    out for every Grozov. Regardless of whether or not they want it, there is always a 
                    back door. Always a way out.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So how do we find this vile exactly?” I interjected before Sophia could even open 
                    her mouth. Lucas stared at me. Silence ensued. I felt out to Noah, William, and 
                    Liam, but they seemed just as clueless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few minutes I heard Noah’s voice. <em>What if we could somehow reach out to Kaiser-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    “NO!” Lucas and I shouted in unison. Noah seemed shocked by our response. 
                    His eyes widened as he covered the corner of his face with his flannel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You wanna invite the psycho killing machine over to us hoping he’ll tell us 
                    how to kill him? Did I catch that right?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia grabbed our shoulders in an attempt to calm us. “Guys, even Newton had his 
                    autistic outbursts before the apple hit him on the head.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas and I stared at one another, then at her before the three of us burst into 
                    laughter. Noah and William looked at us in I assume a condescending manner. 
                    Amidst our ludicrous hyperventilating I heard William’s quiet voice, “I thought 
                    it was a good idea.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We eventually managed to calm down and looked at each other. “So what’re we gonna do?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all sat in silence looking at each other when Lucas seemed to have an epiphany. 
                    His eyes widened as he made eye contact with everyone individually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t just sit there pretty boy, tell us what happened.” Even Sophia’s sarcasm 
                    wasn’t enough to ruin his mood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas spoke out loud. “Remember Krappot Anaka?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ooh, no, I only served under him for half my life.” Liam almost sounded like a monkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas almost seemed like he was going to punch him on the spot. “Ok Liam, 
                    remember what he’d always tell us.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam made a circle with his left thumb and index finger and began moving his right 
                    index finger in and out of it. “No, enlighten me” he raised his voice in an 
                    effort to mock Sophia, who scoffed in amusement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas grabbed his hand and forced it to his side. “If something ever were to 
                    happen to him we were to get to Akala as soon as we could.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we’re just supposed to pack up and go to this island on a whim because some 
                    random guy told you to go there if something bad ever happened? And if you’re 
                    wrong the entire human race gets enslaved by a rampaging demon out to destroy 
                    mankind?” Sophia nearly smacked him with that remark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Have any better ideas princess?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gave my beautiful wife a warm embrace to stop her killing blow from making 
                    contact with our new friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked up at Lucas, “So you know where this island is?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He answered me with an image which flooded my mind. The island was barren and 
                    desolate. The patch of black earth protruding from the midst of a deep blue ocean 
                    seemed insignificant and useless. I looked deeper and saw a single cave protruding 
                    from its surface. It couldn’t have been more than a few kilometers across and a 
                    few hundred meters wide, shaped in a jagged ellipse. Towards one side lay a small 
                    crevice, barely enough for one of us to get through. I don’t know what happened, 
                    but I just knew where it was. I couldn’t have given directions or anything, but 
                    flying I would just know where to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we leave in the morning?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Do you have a better plan?” Liam’s answer even pulled an eye roll from William.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok, pass out, we’ll take first watch,” Noah grabbed William and Liam and fled the cave. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I finally have a moment of peace (as peaceful as I can be). I figured I’d write 
                    this in case I don’t get another chance. Writing is actually kinda nerve racking 
                    now. Up until this point there was always something else going on. Everyone else 
                    was asleep or something. Now I’m just sitting here trying to get things down while 
                    they’re still fresh. Sophia’s currently looking over my shoulder. Ugh, I wish 
                    someone would’ve told me what a creep I’d married. Ah! Now she’s resorted to 
                    violence. Apparently I can’t call her a creep in this journal now? (Is this even 
                    a journal?) I’ve honestly just been keeping it around for a sort of comfort. It 
                    actually helps me a bit to write things down (helps me stop replaying them in my 
                    mind). I didn’t think this would be a problem after the whole demon thing, but 
                    apparently supercomputers can’t process their emotions as well as you’d think. 
                    Anyway it’s crazy. No one’s slept in hours. We figured we’d stop now and recuperate.
                     Funny, the last time this happened I was nearly knocked out by my wife (I guess 
                     that’s whatever). This morning wasn’t any better than two days ago. I’d been on 
                     the morning watch, but honestly it didn’t seem like anyone was coming for us at 
                     all. It doesn’t even seem like Kaiser cares at all. Honestly, if I didn’t know 
                     better, I’d think he’d just forgotten about us. No one’s come after us. No one’s 
                     even tried to stop us. Just after sunset I woke everyone up. Noah and William 
                     had been sleeping stacked on each other for some reason. I still don’t get how 
                     they could possibly stand that. It’s not like they’re small dudes. William had 
                     his left wing spread out on the bottom of the cave with Noah passed out on top 
                     of it. He’d then somehow managed to stretch his opposite leg right in front of 
                     Noah’s face. Lucas and Liam were sleeping on opposite ends of the brothers, just 
                     a few meters from either one. I wasn’t sure how to wake up the pile before me. I 
                     tried thinking out to them but nothing passed through. I projected images as 
                     glaring as I could. Everywhere around me I revealed sequences of flashes and 
                     violently loud bangs, screams, cries, everything. Sophia must’ve noticed my 
                     concentration. I was released from my vision by her tender kiss on my cheek. 
                     I looked up to her warm face smiling back at me.

                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t hurt yourself Eli.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia I really-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She doesn’t listen. She actually never listens. Oh boy, now I’m getting lectured. 
                    You’d think after being married for three years she’d give up on this. At least 
                    now I’m certain this’ll be the last time I write while she’s awake (for my 
                    sanity’s sake at the very least).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked over at Sophia. Granted I knew in advance what she was about to do, but 
                    it still didn’t cease to amuse me (although to be fair, I was expecting she’d use 
                    a smaller rock). The boulder landed directly on William and Noah before it dusted 
                    out of existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They sprung up simultaneously, still conjoined. “What?!” The simultaneously 
                    confused and scared looks on their faces made the entire experience worthwhile. 
                    Noah stared directly at me, seemingly planning his line of attack. William sprung 
                    at Sophia just before being beaten out of the air by a jet black wall. Lucas began 
                    rubbing his wing, staring intently while assessing the situation. “Come on guys, 
                    let’s go.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas stepped out the cave and unfolded his wings, spanning them out fully in the 
                    morning light. <em>Come on!</em> He expressed his irritation as we all left the 
                    cave. In a whirl we all took off into the morning sky. Lucas kept the lead, being 
                    trailed by the others. Sophia clung to me as we kept pursuit. As I felt her lean 
                    body press against mine I just realized she hadn’t eaten in hours. I looked down 
                    in concern, but she knew my thoughts. “Relax Eli, I’m fine.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I barely heard her soft voice over the intense forewind. It continues to baffle me 
                    how someone so beautiful and gentle can possibly become so incredibly savage. We 
                    flew hours behind Lucas, gliding across the wind. I reached out to Lucas only to 
                    be bombarded by his response. A beautiful melody resounded in my ears, filling my 
                    entire being with warmth. I followed the tune, carried away with its beauty. The 
                    others must’ve noticed my absence. Liam overtook me, seizing my right leg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hey, Eli, what-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before he could even think I projected the melody to him. His thoughts stopped 
                    instantly. We reached out to the others, hoping they would hear the music. They 
                    all turned in pursuit of its origin, entranced by the strain. We followed the 
                    song over trees and rivers, yearning for our final destination. Light dimmed as 
                    the melodic voices became clearer. I could tell by the way Sophia clung to me 
                    that she couldn’t see anything. We flew on in hopes of finding the source of the 
                    sound as it intensified when it stopped. I looked around. The clear day had 
                    become pure darkness. No light shone into my eyes. I looked left and right, 
                    glaring, hoping to catch a glimpse of something, only to be greeted by a bleak, 
                    impenetrable shade. I thought out in vain to feel the others. No one was near 
                    but Sophia in my arms. I hovered still, stunned by what had befallen us. The 
                    flap of my wings kept a steady beat by which I could discern some passage of 
                    time. I yelled out, “Lucas!” My voice died almost immediately after I’d let it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His response was reassuring, however, “Eli!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I turned to my right. He sounded as if he was right next to me. I thought out to 
                    him, longing to hear his thoughts, only to find nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam! William! Noah!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They went down,” Lucas’s voice was the only response to my outcries. “Come on.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt the wind blow up against me as he sank directly below us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I even had the chance to follow his example Sophia’s panicked cries 
                    restrained me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, you want to drop nearly a kilometer into presumingly water because some 
                    random people you just met did the same thing?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia I-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Because that’s perfectly fine and all for a literal indestructible demon and 
                    all, but you’re just kinda forgetting about your very mortal wife-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia!” Even facing what likely would’ve been mortal danger I couldn’t muster 
                    anger with her. “Trust me.” She relaxed slightly in my arms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I held on to Sophia so tightly that if I hadn’t felt her breathing I would’ve 
                    been worried I was killing her. Her reciprocating embrace eased my discomfort 
                    about the matter as we fell. The wind picked up as we accelerated towards the 
                    earth’s surface. I focused completely on Sophia to overcome the sheer panic of 
                    the moment. We fell, faster and faster. I calculated our increasing velocity 
                    until I knew we would’ve died on impact when I saw the ground below us. I 
                    panicked as I clung to Sophia when we stopped falling. I thought out to see 
                    Lucas and Liam clinging to us from either side. We descended slowly onto the 
                    barren ground below us. The island wasn’t more than a kilometer long. The ground 
                    was black and barren. Dark, grainy soil covered the surface of the earth, throwing 
                    up dust with every step. Above us and around where the sky should’ve been was a 
                    black sea emitting a faint glow which illuminated the plot of land. The terrain 
                    was smooth, leaving no crevice except for a small depression which led into a 
                    dark, rocky crater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So, this is the magical Grozov juice plant?” Sophia seemed unamused with the island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam couldn’t keep in his excitement upon hearing her remark, “So, this is the 
                    fearless know-it-all who screamed louder than Carthage on the way down?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’d think a thirty year old man-child would have learned his lesson after four 
                    days with an unstable twenty-eight year old woman~~ Ah! One of these days she has 
                    to get tired of hitting me, right? (apparently no she says), but that was nothing 
                    compared to the blow she gave Liam. Before I could even react my beautiful wife’s 
                    right heel was inches into his groin. Liam doubled over in pain, his face 
                    contorted, wheezing as he massaged his penis. Lucas’s amusement flooded our minds 
                    before Liam could react, 
                    <em>Don’t kill the lady just for serving you what you ordered.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He walked over to Liam and helped him stand up straight, whose quick decompression 
                    time fortunately led to a relatively quick recovery (Sophia said I need to explain 
                    the small penis joke. I don’t know why, it’s not like anyone other than us will 
                    ever read this -- and she wasn’t even supposed to read this to begin with). “You 
                    know, there was a time when meeting you was actually a reason to fight for humanity-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok!” Lucas’s shout interrupted what may have been the biggest mistake of Liam’s 
                    life. He looked at the depression before us. I felt his clear unease as we looked 
                    into the crevice. I hugged Sophia to alleviate the tension in my body then thought 
                    to him, <em>Let’s go.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I walked into the cave I felt the cool mist of the ocean air leave in favor for 
                    a stale, dry fluid. The hard stone beat against my talons as we traversed the 
                    tunnel. I could tell Sophia couldn’t see through the dark by the way she held me. 
                    As I wrapped my wings around her I felt the tension flee her muscles. She rested 
                    her warm head around me as I made our way down the dark crevice (similar to right 
                    now, mortal danger seems to have loosened her up somewhat). We all walked on for a 
                    while before I heard a deep gust of wind resound behind me. I wrapped Sophia in my 
                    right wing and turned around, dreading what I’d see. Lucas seemed to do the same. 
                    Everyone was alert except for Liam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” Liam took his palms off his face to reveal his complete ineptitude as we 
                    momentarily stared at each other before replacing them and continuing to blow as 
                    hard as he could. I was about to knock his hand deep into his throat before 
                    Sophia’s soft touch calmed my nerves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Relax, that’s the most productive thing he’s said all day.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas froze before us and turned around. I thought out to him only to realize why. 
                    “We can’t think to each other.” Noah’s voice broke the silence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” Sophia’s annoyance manifested itself as she spoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we can hear-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Your weird feelings thing, yeah.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah, that’s not working.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We waited and stood where we were. In hindsight I’m not really sure why though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So…” Sophia’s voice faltered as she droned on before she finally concluded, “What?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “‘So what,’ princess,” Liam mocked her higher voice while flailing his hands at 
                    his sides, “is that we don’t know where anyone or anything is. ‘So what’ is that 
                    one of us goes and no one knows-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok spare me the ominous rhymes, a simple ‘I have to be aware of my surroundings 
                    would have sufficed.’” It still baffles me how she manages to face death is such 
                    a stupid way (she says it’s because she spends to much time with me, is that good 
                    or bad?). Liam’s sigh and eye roll expressed the general consensus. A minute 
                    passed before anyone said anything. We all just sort of stared at each other, 
                    almost like right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So…” Sophia’s voice faltered as she tried to break the tension. “Are we like 
                    going to move or-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Move?!” Liam’s rage boiled beneath his irritated voice. “We’re diving head first 
                    into a suicide mission to fight a legend among demons and we’ve just lost our 
                    single advantage, and you want us to just move-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What’s you rather have us do? Sit here and wait until-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Guys!” Noah and William’s harmonic voices expressed the most fear I’d heard 
                    until then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” that was the single most sarcastic expression I’d ever heard from Sophia 
                    (she says it’s because I’m always asleep when she mocks me). Noah’s stone face 
                    cracked as he kept his fear from manifesting itself while back from where we came 
                    from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia began to turn as she continued to rant (I’m sorry, ‘think audibly for the 
                    collective benefit of all around.’ At this rate I’ll have to let her edit this 
                    entire journal). “Don’t tell me, your telepathy’s fine but these losers just can’t 
                    seem to muster-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She stopped abruptly upon seeing the mass before us: standing three meters tall 
                    on four legs was a beast unlike anything I’d seen before (with the exception of, 
                    according to Sophia, Liam. I’m glad he can’t hear any of this or we’d have 
                    something coming -- mainly Sophia). Lean body was conjoined to four strong legs, 
                    each supporting what seemed to be hundreds of pounds. Jet black, leathery skin 
                    coated a muscular frame. Scales appeared on dark underbelly beneath layers of mat 
                    black fur. Ice appeared underneath four padded paws, out of which protruded curved, 
                    conical talons three inches long which allowed the beast to grip the surface it 
                    stood on. A dark, wiry mane covered its neck and shoulders. A tail was oscillating 
                    nearly a meter behind it, capped with a rigid geometric dart, scrapping the stone 
                    floor and sparking everywhere it made contact. Breaking the darkness of its figure 
                    were rows of jagged, undulate, pearly white teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Great Liam, seems like you’ve brought us pest control.” My wife’s sarcastic tones 
                    were answered with a low growl. “Look, no need-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Is now really the time?” for the first time in the four days I’d known him Liam 
                    didn’t retort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia,” I spoke softly as I unfolded my wings between the beast and herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, think.” She told me to think as I entered my first fight with a demonic 
                    lion, yeah. “Eli!” Her irritation began to overpower her fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes, dear?” I~~ (apparently she forgot about that until right now, I really 
                    shouldn’t document everything) managed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We got here through a tunnel,” she spoke in the same condescending tone she 
                    used to use when congratulating me at Stanford.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And we didn’t see this thing on the way here.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “On with it, woman!” Liam’s patience had withered as the creature approached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So there’s some other tunnel out,” she seemed almost annoyed that we couldn’t 
                    piece that together for ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lucas deepened his voice as he looked through the darkness behind the animal. 
                    “She speaks the truth.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What’s up with the accent, pretty boy?” she almost seemed amused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If I’ve always wanted to say that in context.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia’s scoff revealed her amusement. I hugged her tightly under my wings as 
                    Noah and William lept towards the brute from opposite directions. A warm blanket 
                    of flames engulfed me as I leapt through the tunnel. Lucas and Liam came up from 
                    behind us and threw us through. The crevice we stood in was nearly identical to 
                    the one before it. I looked back to see a smooth disc large enough to cover the 
                    crevice before us. It’s actually the one I’m currently leaning against. The dark 
                    figures of Noah and William encircled and entangled with the cloud of the beast. 
                    Black flames erouted from the cloud. Reflective, dark liquid flew from the being 
                    as the fight ensued. Ripping sounds resonated throughout the cave as flesh flew 
                    from the beast and landed roasted on the cold, dark floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Noah! William!” Lucas’s voice boomed in the small chamber. Noah looked up from 
                    the massacre, his black face covered in pure, jet black blood. Malleable, tender 
                    lumps of flesh covered his figure and filled his mouth as he tore and the neck 
                    of the monster. He faded back into the mass before. We looked on, hopeful, waiting 
                    for their return from the encounter. The mass swarmed back again as William became 
                    visible, his leathery skin coated to luster even in such darkness. His body seemed 
                    bulked with the amount of flesh covering him. He extended his wing against the 
                    rock, revealing to us the pearly white ribs and off grey inner workings of the 
                    winged atrocity before sealing us from the intense exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I embraced Sophia as we stared at the wall which stood before us which completely 
                    suppressed the slaughter behind it. Some minutes passed as we looked at each 
                    other through the darkness. Sophia clung to me as I led her to lean against the 
                    wall. The chamber we entered seemed to be a tunnel leading off somewhere. Liam 
                    and Lucas sat beside us, completely stunned by the encounter. For the first time 
                    Lucas just broke the silence. “We have to keep going.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Are you insane?” Sophia’s thoroughly annoyed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Listen princess,” now Liam’s getting involved, this is going to end badly. 
                    “We’ve been doing all of this to save your stupid race, and now two of our best 
                    friends are as good as dead fighting an unkillable whatever. We’re not just going 
                    to sit here-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Take a break!” I don’t think I’ve heard Sophia yell this loud since I derived 
                    Maxwell’s Equations faster than her back in grad school (she insists I cheated 
                    being a supercomputer and everything). “Two of your best friends are dead and you 
                    want to run head first into a thermonuclear bomb site for what? You’re not going 
                    to accomplish anything by flailing like a headless chicken until someone kills you!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And I’m not going to accomplish anything sitting here like a duck in a pond until 
                    something else kills me? In case you aren’t aware a fire-breathing lion-dragon 
                    just showed up trying to shred us apart! And you want to sit here and wait for 
                    whatever’s next? The literal fate of humanity is at risk, and we have no idea when 
                    Kaiser will attack. We might already be too late! All of this because you want to 
                    sit here and wait for whatever’s next. We have no idea-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam!” Lucas and I are getting good at yelling in tandem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Relax. You’re tired, irritated, and scared. You’re not working for Anaka anymore. 
                    We’re here on a suicide mission. No one will come and help us. No one will rescue 
                    us. Noah and William are dead. No one’s going to stop training and help them, so 
                    just shut up and focus for once in your life!” I seriously don’t think I’ve ever 
                    seen Lucas this angry. Liam’s just standing there now. It’s almost as if that was 
                    the the first stupid thing he’s ever said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So now what?” Liam managed to keep his voice steady as he controlled his temper. 
                    “We haven’t eaten or drank anything in nearly a day and you expect us to just sit 
                    here and wait until we fight whatever and drop dead? At the very least the twins 
                    got in a meal.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Fine!” Now Sophia’s really irritated. “We’ll wait here for a while and get some 
                    sleep. When we’re all good we can keep up the suicide mission. Happy?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam’s pouting now. I feel like I can silently enjoy this, all things considered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Put this away and get to bed. Seriously Eli, you don’t need to write down 
                    everything. You’re a literally supercomputer. Just go to sleep.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seriously, when did she become so demanding? She says it’s when I took her to a 
                    different realm to fight a losing battle. Now she’s taking the book again! Some day~~

                <p>
                    Liam is an idiot. Liam is literally an idiot. That moron seriously doesn’t have 
                    more than two functioning brain cells. He’s been alive for nearly thirty years but 
                    he acts like he’s only been here for three. Actually, he might as well be mentally 
                    retarded. I wouldn’t be surprised if after I kill him I find the two halves of his 
                    brain are physically disconnected. Kaiser can slaughter humanity for all I care, as 
                    long as I see him personally gut that moron with his own wing. I’d actually rejoice 
                    if I came back and found his corpse in that stupid cave. RETARD! If Sophia doesn’t 
                    live until next week then neither will he. There, it’s in writing. If that inutile 
                    waste of life should’ve been the one getting his flesh ripped apart! Absolute 
                    ignoramus! It’s some time in the day (I think) on this Akala heap. We’ve been out 
                    here for nearly two days. At least I’ve been able to “sleep” alone here (as much as 
                    I can). That’s no concern for Sophia, no, she’s been unconscious the entire time! No 
                    worries, no pain, no nothing. She might be in a coma, for Liam’s life can only be in 
                    a coma. What does it matter anymore? If she doesn’t wake up everyone dies. Kaiser 
                    comes for us and we have a done deal. It’s not like William, Noah, or Lucas care, 
                    because, gratitude due to Liam, they’re all dead! Moron! Absolute moron! I should’ve 
                    just killed that idiot when we woke up, back when Sophia was mobile and it would’ve 
                    made a difference. The cave was still completely black, and the tunnel we were in 
                    lead straight down. When I woke up Sophia had propped her head out from under my wing 
                    and was actively caressing my scaly head. I looked her into her eyes as I shed my 
                    wings and let out the black bush I kept on my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Come on Eli, your scales looked much better than your face.” Her delicate, light 
                    brown eyes light with amusement as she chuckled while insulting me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If you thought that was pretty, have a look at the most beautiful thing I’ve found 
                    since I met you,” I was pretty clever as I pulled her hair over her eyes and stood up. 
                    I walked over to Liam and was about to R.K.O him (I really should’ve taken that 
                    opportunity, that mindless meat head) before Sophia grabbed my face and turned me 
                    around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia,” I turned, revealing my fleshy face, “Don’t just grab me, you’ll seriously 
                    cut yourself-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Cool it dragon boy. If I can wash your boxers for nearly three years, I can handle 
                    some relatively soft scales-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Okay, what do you want?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I just figured that since we have a moment alone-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, we’ve had literally every single one of these talks throughout the last three 
                    years. I-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just shut up smart boy.” She chuckled as she insulted me (yeah, she thinks she’s 
                    really funny).
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Noah and William just died yesterday-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Are probably alive and waiting to be rescued-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No Eli, they’re as good as dead-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, just-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok, shut it!” That was the first time she’d snapped at me since I (granted incorrectly) 
                    corrected her solution to a system of linear diophantine equations (in my defense 
                    her handwriting was chicken scratch after the hours she’d spent working on it). 
                    “Noah and William were some of your demon friends who were literally half dragon.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Use your ridiculously over complicated brain!” she stared at me as if I was 
                    supposed to conclude something. “If I die, shut it,” she held my jaw closed when 
                    she saw me about to object, “If I die then it wasn’t your fault, I love you.” 
                    Looking at her now, I realize how much of a favor she’d done for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No worries Sophia, nothing-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, promise me you’ll be fine.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What do you want-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli,” her voice faltered as she snuggled me, pushing her head deep into my chest. 
                    Then her delicate blue eyes met mine, swelling with tears. I couldn’t say anything 
                    then. That was the second time I’d ever seen her really cry since her mom died last 
                    year, “Eli” her voice faltered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, everything’s ok. I’m not going to let anything happen to you. Believe me-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And what if something does?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, you perfectly safe-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s not about me,” she scolded me softly so as not to wake up the others. Still, 
                    I was taken aback. “Eli, the moment I met you I loved you. You were the only one 
                    who wasn’t threatened by me. Everyone else at that stupid school hated me.” Her 
                    tears began flowing as she spoke. “I got to my dorm every night and slept alone. 
                    No one ever talked to me. No one would dare condescend themselves enough to even 
                    think they weren’t the smartest person alive, but you did-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Do you think that was a challenge?” as I said that I remembered the last time we’d 
                    had this conversation before we were married. “I told you three years ago and I’m 
                    telling you know, you are the best thing that has ever and could possibly ever 
                    happen to me. You’re Sophia,” I grabbed her face and made her look at me as she 
                    began to stare at the ground. “You’re Sophia, the princess who chose the socially 
                    awkward, bearded geek in a school full of outgoing geniuses. You’re Sophia who 
                    didn’t run away from an actual winged monster as he proposed. You’re Sophia who-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Who forced herself into this situation when you were determined to keep me out of 
                    it. I’m Sophia who just killed her husband’s wife-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just promise me one thing,” that she said confidently, staring me down as she held 
                    my face in place. “If I die, you’ll know that it wasn’t your fault. That you were 
                    the best thing that has ever happened to me and that I couldn’t wish for anything 
                    more.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia, nothing-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli!” she scolded in a whisper, “Promise me,” she paused, “Promise me that you’ll 
                    know it wasn’t your fault.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I promise.” Seeing her now I’ve learned to forgive my lying tongue, some promises 
                    are just too hard to keep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then she started looking at me as if I’d burnt a turkey (guess how I know that look).
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” although that time I wasn’t particularly confused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Say it,” she commanded with such authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stared directly into her eyes before choking her in an embrace, “You know I love 
                    you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then that cretin opened his mouth in a mockingly deep voice, “Hey Lucas, look, the 
                    little love birdies have risen from their slumber.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You sensual animal! How long-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Seriously, relax princess.” Liam’s face beamed with amusement, “We just woke up.” 
                    He was leaning against the cave wall about a meter before us, and I know that if 
                    Sophia could see in the dark she would’ve strangled him on the spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So,” Lucas interrupted before they had a chance to have at one another. “What’s 
                    the plan?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Plan?” Liam seemed thoroughly annoyed. “What? Were you drunk last night? We go on 
                    now and find the stava. We’ve only been out here for four days trying to find that 
                    stupid drink to save <em>your</em> moronic race-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam!” Lucas was seriously out of patience. “Everyone here would rather that none 
                    of this every happened, so the very least you could do-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Shut up Lucas!” He was mad. I travelled with a mad retard. If it hadn’t been for 
                    Sophia I might actually have killed him. He was seriously nothing but a ridiculous 
                    hinderince. “I watched my parents die when I was eight. Eight! Do you remember what 
                    you were doing when you were eight?” He was looking at Sophia as he spoke. “Oh, my 
                    dollies and my candies, ahh.” The moron raised the pitch of his voice as he 
                    emphasized his slander. “My besties and I doing our hair, making the braiding train-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Get on with it!” Sophia was thoroughly annoyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s not a game anymore!” He paused after that, looking down as he suddenly became 
                    aware of his newfound instability. “It’s not a game anymore,” he repeated softly. 
                    Looking back he was emotional, but still a retard. Still mentally disabled 
                    nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam,” Lucas’s voice came gentle that time. “They’re not dead, calm down. Once we 
                    find the stava we’ll have them back, and you know it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam looked around, furrowing his brow before he managed to relax. After a few 
                    minutes Lucas spoke, “Regardless of what we find, we need to keep together, agreed?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Agreed,” our response resonated as the three of us answered in unison and continued 
                    along the cave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trotted on for what must’ve been hours. The tunnel narrowed until we had to 
                    walk in distinct pairs. Lucas and that imbecile kept at a constant two meters ahead 
                    of Sophia and I. We kept in that formation for a few hours until Sophia stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia,” my concern was evident in my voice. “What’s wrong?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She leaned against the side of the tunnel, massaging her calves for a while before 
                    she spoke. “Squat for a second.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, squat for a second.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then she did it. Granted I saw it coming, but it still didn’t make carrying her any 
                    easier. “You can finish Stanford’s triathlon in fifty-five minutes but you can’t 
                    walk a few kilometers without being carried?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You seem to have an adequate understanding of the situation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We continued after that for what felt like hours (although it probably wasn’t that 
                    long) before I ran into Lucas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why’d we stop?” Sophia’s voice echoed in the narrow tunnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In case you haven’t noticed, princess, we’re at the end of the tunnel.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What do you mean ‘we’re at the end of the tunnel?’”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Use your eyes, genius,” Liam stepped aside to reveal a solid stone wall. “We’re at 
                    the end of the tunnel.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia started looking around the cave walls for anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Stop it princess! We’re at the end of the tunnel!” The dullard was thoroughly 
                    annoyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “At least I’m trying to find a way forward-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There is no way. Look around, you moron! There isn’t another way except-” The 
                    simpleton was interrupted when a tone resonated through the cavern. Breaking the 
                    darkness were thin, fiery symbols hovering above us, which emitted enough orange 
                    light that Sophia didn’t need me to see anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial t}A(y,t) + 6 \Lambda \Omega \ (y^2 - y) sin(t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}A(y,t)$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}A(t, 0) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}A(t, 1) = 0$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?!” Liam and Lucas shouted in unison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Aren’t you guys living computers?” Sophia’s face was glowing in the light of the 
                    problem as she condescended them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And that makes us wizards who can understand these magic runes.” The heathen’s 
                    voice rang a sarcastic note. I should’ve punched him. I should’ve knocked him out 
                    there and then, so we wouldn’t be in this mess. No one would’ve blamed me, and 
                    I’d’ve done everyone a huge favor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia and I used to solve these differential equations back at Stanford. We 
                    studied it for a few minutes before she spoke, “Where do we solve it?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked at her and laughed. I’d been so focused on the equation the entire time 
                    that I hadn’t realized I didn’t even know what to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then that moron actually did something useful. “This is ridiculous!” He started 
                    walking forward, ignoring Lucas’s hand trying to hold him back. “You two just see 
                    this random nonsense and decide-” his scream interrupted him as he hit the plane 
                    the equation was on. He started rubbing off char as smoke slowly emanated from his 
                    black body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia didn’t even try to hide her excitement, “Eli, look! The incompetent 
                    ignoramus actually did something useful.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where the cretin hit the depth the equation was on was a perfect, razor-thin red 
                    outline of his body. The buffoon looked up in disgust at his outline, then with 
                    amusement at Sophia, “Like it or not princess, you couldn’t solve this without me.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smiling, Sophia approached the equation before I held her hand back. “Sophia, 
                    you’re going to hurt yourself.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “As if you wouldn’t.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah but-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Relax Eli. I’ll be fine.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She began tracing her finger under the equation, writing in a line of fire as she 
                    did. I joined her while the others silently sat behind us. After about fifteen 
                    minutes we’d reduced the equation and found the roots of the first term 
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$r = &plusmn (\Omega i)^{1/2}$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    before being interrupted as the wall before us slid about twenty centimeters to 
                    the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That’s it?!” That’s when he did it. That’s when Liam, in his immense stupidity, 
                    did it. “We’ve just been sitting here so you could open the door less than a foot-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam!” Lucas had his wings clenched in his hands as tried in vain to stop that 
                    lamebrained simpleton from running through the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s open just walk through!” Liam expressed his agony as he forced his way 
                    through the invisible barrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moron! What a moron!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia directed my head towards the closing wall as she clung to me. I 
                    reciprocated her embrace as I wrapped my wings around her and lept through the 
                    barrier. In the seconds as we crossed my body exploded. White hot, burning pain 
                    exploded throughout my body while my scales erupted as we flew through the barrier 
                    and dove through what intercise was left. Burning pain erupted through my back as 
                    we landed and skidded across a rough stone floor. In place of the door we’d jumped 
                    through was a section of the cave precisely like the rest. I looked around. We were 
                    in a perfectly cylindrical room with a radius that couldn’t have been more than a 
                    hundred meters. Contrary to the stale, uniformly warm environment of the caves we 
                    were in, the cavern had a dynamic air flow. Cool drafts constantly came and were 
                    replaced by warm breezes, perpetually inflamming and relaxing my exposed raw flesh. 
                    Looking up the uniform black environment was interrupted by a grey light, and 
                    realized that the lack of a ceiling was the cause for the new environment. I 
                    unfolded my wing to let Sophia out. Her amber hair fluttered as her skin glowed, 
                    emphasizing her beauty. Even now, unconscious, her complexion remains unblemished. 
                    Her soft, warm hand caressed my face as she spoke, “Eli, we did it. The stava, it’s 
                    here.” She tried to lift my head, but stopped after my painful groan. That was it. 
                    That was the last thing I’d heard from her. Looking at her now I can’t even remember 
                    the full extent of the pain I was in, just those words, the last words I’d heard from 
                    her. Right now, looking at her, the red on my body is nothing more than a color. I 
                    lost myself in her immaculate eyes before a cold, emotionless voice brought me back 
                    to reality, “Yes, it seems you have done it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stood up and supported myself against the side of the cave (to Sophia’s objections) 
                    as we turned towards the direction of the voice. In the center of the cave, within a 
                    meter from the stava, mist parted to reveal the ten meter ghostly outline of a demon. 
                    Invisible wings curled back into the center of the figure as four of its kind landed 
                    next to it. From the outlines appeared black masses, each of which no longer disturbed 
                    the mist as they walked. From my side I felt Sophia shuffle her hand around her until 
                    she found what I assume was a rock she was about to throw, but she stopped as one of 
                    the demons spoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Elijah, do you think it wise that your wife attack your cousins?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried in vain to approach them as Sophia held me back. She stared at the demons, 
                    stone faced, as her grip tightened on the rock. I grabbed her hand as she tried to 
                    step forward. “Sophia…” my voice wavered as I looked at her before resting my head on 
                    the wall. I stared into her fearless face, silently pleading with her not to do 
                    anything rash, before she reluctantly set the rock down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cylindrical rocks emerged from the ground before the cold, unwavering voice resounded 
                    throughout the cave again. “We seem to be in the mood for diplomacy. Take a seat.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia struggled to help me to the stools, but to to avail. The demon observed our 
                    struggle with disappointment. A frown appeared on his thin, elliptical, grey face. 
                    His frail, bony body, wrapped in thin, leathery grey skin waited on a stool as he 
                    rested his arm on his leg, supporting his head as he frowned at us. After a moment 
                    he rose to help us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Enough of this, woman!” he raised his voice over Sophia’s, clearly annoyed with our 
                    delay, before he threw me over his shoulders and set me on a stool himself. As he 
                    returned to his place Sophia noticed my pain sitting up and helped me to the floor 
                    so I could lean against the stool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We all thought you’d take our hint after Madadh tied up your two friends yesterday. 
                    You Stanford folk aren’t as apt as you make yourselves out to be.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia stroked my head as we both silently stared intently at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Say something, or is this just how you greet your family?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I glared at him, equally as dazed as dumbstruck, unable to forge my thoughts into 
                    words. After a while he turned to his compatriots. “I always thought I would find 
                    Anaka’s genes in at least a semicompetent mind, considering everything he was.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time I couldn’t remember where I’d heard that name before, but Sophia was alert 
                    and quick to respond, “What does the last galah of that wasteland have anything to do 
                    with us?” She began covering me as she spoke, almost shielding me in her bosom as she 
                    stroked the back of my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Now, is that anyway to talk about your grandfather-in-law?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even semi-conscious I managed to focus intently after that. Sophia dropped her 
                    hostility as she sat next to me. We both looked at them as they sat on the stools 
                    around us. The blue stava faintly radiated light onto each of us as we sat around it. 
                    Mist gathered itself in a wall before us four meters long and three meters tall. 
                    It slowly condensed together until it became solid white. A silent scene began playing. 
                    A burning city falling to ruins as someone flew high above it. Dark, black smoke covered 
                    the sky, making it impossible to determine the time of day. What seemed to once 
                    have been a valley was now a bowl of fire. Houses slowly burned, collapsing suddenly 
                    as families shared their last moments atop them. Thin cobblestone streets, untouched 
                    by the fire, became channels for freshly spilled blood to flow to the center of the 
                    city, at which lay a deep red pool. The scene changed. A woman sat cradling a child 
                    at the edge of the pool, caressing it while protecting it in her bosom. She seemed 
                    frail as she weekly extended a cupped hand towards the liquid. A screech stopped her 
                    as a talon dug into her exposed elbow. She screamed and writhed in pain as 
                    drop-by-drop her blood slowly leaked from the demon and contributed itself to the 
                    pool. Standing before, manipulating her arm to his liking was an unseeable figure. 
                    The demon’s shadow absorbed all the light which touched him, making him purely dark. 
                    It loomed about two meters above her as it emitted a chuckle, <em>“Dipsasménos?”</em> 
                    Its voice was cold and almost unintelligible. Every consonant sounded like grinding 
                    steel. The figure turned the woman over with the grasp it had on her arm, exposing 
                    the child she had hidden. She began screaming more panicked now, as if pleading with 
                    the demon as he grabbed the child around their neck. <em>“Etsi eímai egó.”</em> In a 
                    flash the child’s head landed next to his mother’s, who cradled it as she sobbed. The 
                    infant’s body hung from Varnam’s mouth as he ate the child from the inside out before 
                    throwing what was left onto his mother. 
                    <em>“Eseís oi ánthropoi eíste díkaioi...toso kala.”</em> 
                    He stuck out his hand to the mother and clenched his fingers around her neck before 
                    lifting her off the ground. The mist dissolved as the scene ended. Everyone was 
                    sitting where they had been. The demon’s voice rang as he spoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I hope you understand now. About our unwillingness to give you the stava.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia retorted before I could collect my thoughts. “You want that to happen again? 
                    Seriously? Because that’s exactly what Kaiser will do. That’s-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Enough,” the demon held up his hand as he interrupted Sophia. She seemed keen to 
                    argue but held back as she waited for him to speak. “Anaka’s mistakes were his own. 
                    Your grandfather-in-law left us. He took the stava with him, not us. He-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What does Anaka have to do with any of this!” Sophia’s grip tightened on my hand as 
                    she shouted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli, you don’t really think you were a demon by mistake? And you never wondered how 
                    Ryan knew?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Your stupid telekenesis!” Sophia wouldn’t let a word slip from my mouth. “Eli was 
                    born genitically altered, and Ryan could see him with his stupid mind tricks!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No,” his voice gained some life as he condescended Sophia. “Anaka mingled into 
                    interbreeding, and it seems like Eli simply decided to continue his family’s legacy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He stopped talking while Sophia waited for him to continue. “So you’re telling me 
                    Ryan was Anaka’s son, sure, but he wasn’t Eli’s father.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He stared at us before he changed the scene on the screen. Ryan was holding a baby 
                    as he and my parents were both standing in our living room. I visit my parents often, 
                    but it’d been so long since I’d seen Ryan’s face. It was different. I was seeing him 
                    clearly, not just from memory. His curly brown hair draped loosely around the sides 
                    of his head, keeping clear of his face. His brown eyes were cold as he tried to keep 
                    his stern expression, which started fading and giving way to tears. Dad sat on his 
                    right and mom on his left, each holding a hand as they comforted him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ryan, he’ll thank you for this, you’re doing the right thing.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t you think I know that?!” That was the only time I’d ever heard him snap like 
                    that. “Imagine everything I’ll never get to do, everything I’m giving you instead.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Imagine everything you’re giving him right now. A normal life. A life away from 
                    these race wars. A life where what happened to Sarah can’t happen again.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ryan took out his wallet and stared at a picture of himself with a strong, blond 
                    woman. Her features were sculpted as her blue eyes pierced strands of straight hair. 
                    At the bottom of the image was what I assumed the years she lived, “1933 - 1965.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Did you know we’d been married for a full four years? I feel like I only just met 
                    her yesterday.” He returned the image to its place and put his wallet back in his 
                    pocket. “And Eli was our son. We were going to be a completely normal family.” He 
                    held his finger out before me and smiled as I grabbed it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dad waited a few minutes before interrupting, “Ryan, it’s best that you leave. The 
                    longer you stay the longer,” he paused and gentured at Ryan while he chose his words, 
                    “your kind has to find him.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ryan smiled at him as he got up to leave. “Yes, I suppose you’re right.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mist faded, and I found myself staring at the demons before me. “You didn’t 
                    really think you just stumbled upon our singing, did you? It was dad. When he had 
                    us take the stava and kill him he sent his voice to guide us back here in case we 
                    got lost. Only Varnam’s ears can hear his voice.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sat still, relaxed as I let the stool hold my weight, focusing on the air inflame 
                    and relax my exposed flesh. Sophia rested her hand on mine as she tried to relax me, 
                    and for the first time since I’d known her, her touch didn’t ease my pain. I recoiled 
                    away from her as pain consumed my body. She recoiled, looking solemnly at me as tears 
                    welled up in her eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My heart broke before my cousin’s austere voice tore me from the sight. That was it. 
                    That was the last encounter we’d had. Here and now, writing this all down, I still 
                    can’t comprehend it. She was there, alive. She gave me life I didn’t know I’d had in 
                    me, and now here she is, her limp body rising and sinking slowly as she breaths while 
                    her heart has stopped beating. Alone. Alone with a crippled man and nobody else, 
                    nobody to help her, nothing to be done. I’ll kill him. If I ever see Liam again, 
                    I’ll kill him for this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m sorry for your time, Elijah, you can join your friends now.” Flapping his wings 
                    my cousin gathered another veil of mist before us, being thrown about in the wind 
                    despite not being suspended by anything. Through it I could see everyone, the twins, 
                    Lucas, and the imbecile, all laying on the ground in some pasture, completely 
                    unconscious. Sophia stood up and shouted before I could process the situation, 
                    “Lucas! Liam!-” The veil disappeared before she could finish. We sat there as the 
                    five towered over us, extending their wings baring their fangs as they approached us. 
                    “Let me make myself abundantly clear. You may join your friends now. Go!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia retorted almost instantly, “Let me make myself abundantly clear, give us the 
                    stava!” She stood as spoke, anticipating the imminent conflict. They were the only 
                    thing between us and the blue vile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the demons could speak, our friend opened his mouth in a violent array of 
                    words. “We have been moving this vile across the globe for millennia, protecting 
                    mankind from people like yourself, and you expect us to create another unstoppable 
                    force because of some psychotic killer who came about because of your grandfather?!” 
                    He grew in size as he wrapped his hand in his wing. As he pulled it out a line of 
                    stygian flames followed it, solidifying themselves into a blade. One by one the others 
                    were engulfed in a thick, white mist, fading along with it. He stared at us before 
                    exclaiming, “Emshi hier seychas! A prosopo ewaquib!” Thin black flames formed the 
                    phrase behind him: <em>Leave now! Or face your consequences!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I moved to get up before Sophia pushed me back down. “Sophia, stop it. Let me-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Relax, you can’t-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She held her hand over my mouth as she looked into my eyes, “You’ve been crying through 
                    your dragon skin. Your scales have long since been ripped to pieces. Just hang tight-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sophia-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s a good thing you’ve found her Elijah. She clearly has more sense than you can 
                    hope to attain.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked Sophia in the eyes, lamenting what I was about to do. I can’t believe I did 
                    this. After that cretin, I’m to blame. I did this. I hurt her like this. Standing up, 
                    as she leaped to my aid, I gave my response, “no.” With a swift stroke my wing thrust 
                    her to the ground as I engaged my cousin. I can’t believe it. This was my fault. Liam’s 
                    role was infinitesimally smaller than mine. He was scared, I hurt her. I hadn’t had the 
                    time to look back before a black mass collided with my chest and pinned me against the 
                    cave, “Bold choice, your great grandfather would be very proud.” The mist thickened 
                    around me until I was completely blind. I didn’t know where Sophia was. Persisted in 
                    vain to turn and look at her as a grip emerged around my neck, tightening itself as I 
                    resisted. Everything became a white screen while my flesh burned as talons drove their 
                    way into my body, quickly lathering it in my black blood. Screeches resounded in my 
                    ears as forces began to compress my torso, “Du banaanya gaya, dverger!” I heard bones 
                    shattering as I struggled to escape. I squirmed for what couldn’t have been more than 
                    twenty seconds before the rest of my body erupted in pain. It seemed as if every square 
                    centimeter of my body was being torn apart. I went limp as black, silky muscles found 
                    their way off my bones. I struggled to steal a glimpse at Sophia before it was over. 
                    The mist cleared. I laid there, muscles loosely attached to bone, as the five leviathans 
                    became petrified, fixated on the stava. I followed their gaze as I saw Sophia, limp and 
                    breathless, on the ground beside the shattered glass which once held the coveted brew. 
                    Everything was silent except for the gentle breeze cooling the area. Seeing her now, in 
                    the same state, the same look of determination and confidence frozen on her face, I wish 
                    they’d killed me then and there. I don’t know how I did it. I don’t know how I’m doing it. 
                    Her chest slowly rising and falling as she lays there. I should’ve done it. I 
                    should’ve taken the stava. It should’ve been me. Everything should’ve been me. 
                    The holes in my flesh don’t even begin to compensate. My cousin turned to me with 
                    a look of indifference, “Shame, she really was a beauty.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked up at his malevolent, vicious face. His calm features were enunciated by 
                    his taught, grey skin as he walked towards me. “You’d think someone as smart as 
                    her would’ve had the foresight-” He was swept away by a looming black mass as big 
                    as he was hurtled him away from me. I looked back towards Sophia to see a demon 
                    standing almost fifty meters from me, where she’d drunk the stava. Her figure was 
                    strong and commanding, scales and spikes dynamically appeared and disappeared on 
                    her body as she imposed herself on the others. Muscles bulged beneath her shimmering 
                    scales which reacted to her environment, fluidly recoloring themselves according to 
                    a spectrum of vibrant, majestic hues. She slowly unfolded her translucent wings, 
                    which sang as they pierced the air around her. I watched in awe as she lifted herself 
                    up through the tunnel, appearing in quick flashes of accented light magenta. A 
                    bright white flame illuminated my cousin’s face as he was lifted into the air. 
                    Images of extreme focus appeared on his and Sophia’s faces as he was thrown about 
                    by the neck. Throughout all of that she remained graceful, firing blow for blow as 
                    she gradually dismembered my relative. A mist appeared around the two as they 
                    struggled, leaving a trail around them until nothing could be seen in the cave. 
                    Wherever they went Sohpia’s aura illuminated a small area. I saw my cousins flee 
                    as they noticed their partner’s fate. In quick rushes they lifted themselves up 
                    through the mist out of the cave. The mist cleared as I saw Sophia standing before 
                    me, wrapping herself in her wings. I looked into her eyes as time stopped. It was 
                    the longest and shortest moment I’d ever had with her. My best and worst time. She 
                    came over to me and embraced me in a way she’d never done before, still covering 
                    her midsection. I looked into her eyes for what felt like an instant before she 
                    spoke. “Fly us up quickly.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We embraced one another as I lifted myself up through the air. For the first time 
                    the mist relaxed my back as I rose through it. She covered herself in her wings as 
                    we ascended up until we reached the extent of the mist, looking out into a vivacious 
                    landscape. The sweet scent of flowers tickled my nose as my eyes adjusted to the 
                    warm sun’s light. The grass tickled my feet as I landed. Sophia’s scales shone and 
                    glowed an array of colors in the new environment, illuminating the vibrant greenery 
                    around her. She directed me to where we’re sitting now before telling me to lay here 
                    on her back while her head emerged from the cocoon of her wings. I looked into her 
                    eyes. Despite her new face, her eyes were still the same. She reciprocated my look 
                    as her scales slowly gave way to her radiant, soft skin. She smiled at me as she 
                    moved her hands to cover the Stanford S in the middle of her shirt. I’d just realized 
                    she was wearing that. She usually wears whatever I have enough cash to pay for 
                    whenever she visits the mall. How much I would pay to be wasting money with her 
                    right now. Right now, when all she can do is lay there, unmoving. My heart pounded 
                    as her teeth flashed a smile at me. I know her smile, and I knew the way she was 
                    looking at me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Eli,” her voice wavered as she began to lift her shirt, “Don’t look now.” Her 
                    lower abdomen was covered with bright, vibrant red blood originating from around 
                    a stone filling a jagged hole seven centimeters in diameter towards her lower torso. 
                    Her smile faded as she closed her eyes. The grass felt like sandpaper, the sun like 
                    an oven. The very air I breeth burns my lungs. Her bleeding stopped almost instantly 
                    after. A thin layer of skin began to develop to cover her wounds. It seems like the 
                    stava is the only thing keeping her alive right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing this down hasn’t helped. It hasn’t done anything. Liam’s dead. When I see 
                    him, he’s dead. There’s nothing I can do right now for Sophia. She’s here, laying 
                    on the grass for who knows how long, but Liam can be dealt with. I~~
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam’s dead…
                </p>
                <p>
                    …It’s been almost an hour since the others came by. They’ve gone to lie down 
                    somewhere shady (probably under a layer of dirt). I’m staying here with Sophia. 
                    All we can do is wait and hope for something when she wakes up. I can’t believe 
                    he’s dead. After everything he’s done, after everything he’s survived…I always 
                    thought if he were going to die on this trip that I would be the one to kill him. 
                    I almost wanted to be the one to kill him. He was just lost, sick. He’d lost his 
                    family once when his parents died during Kaiser’s rise, then he lost his friends 
                    trying to save others like his family. Even in the three days I’d spent with him, 
                    he was always someone who’d never stop fighting. Always determined. Always passionate. 
                    Apparently after he and Lucas had gotten shut out of the last cave the first cave 
                    opened back for them. Fluffy had stopped fighting Noah and William as soon as they 
                    tired out, all three had been laying on the cave floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was too late. He couldn’t bear knowing that the twins were stuck behind us while 
                    he was just sitting there.” Tears began to flow through pre-prepared channels on 
                    Lucas’s face. “He wanted the stava. He wanted the twins back. He wouldn’t stop trying 
                    to get past the differential equation. He kept pushing after you, thinking that 
                    he could do what you did.” Lucas broke down before he could finish, choosing instead 
                    to send me the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I saw the door we’d just gone through closed, Liam still trying to push past the 
                    equation. His scales sizzled and his screams intensified the longer he stayed in it. 
                    Lucas tried to pull him back by the leg. “It’s not worth it. Liam, Noah and William 
                    are alive. They’re gone. The stava is gone. We’ll find another way out. Liam!” Lucas 
                    shouted in vain as he tried to pull through. Fire erupted wherever his body crossed 
                    the equation’s plane, consuming his flesh as he persisted in agony to get by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They’re all I have.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’ll find another way-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “There is no other way, Lucas. The longer we wait, the-” He pauses, struggling to 
                    release the words, “the more likely we’ll find them dead.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Let go, Lucas!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liam-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “LET GO!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hadn’t felt such a measure of pain and sadness before. I collapsed on the spot as 
                    I saw Liam kill himself trying to get to us, to his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It wasn’t long after that that the door opened behind me and I came back out here 
                    with Noah and William.” Lucas’s voice was barely a choked whisper as he finished his 
                    account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was when I really began to miss Sophia. I’d always felt her pain, and the agony 
                    of seeing her the way that she is, but that was when I truly realized how much I 
                    depended on her, how much I couldn’t do alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas…” my voice faltered as I hugged him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thanks Eli. You know, you meant the world to him. After you ran headfirst into a 
                    fight with Kaiser he said he’d do anything for you. That you were one of us. He even 
                    said that he would’ve died for Sophia, believe it or not, and I guess he did.” He 
                    gestured towards Sophia, “Speaking of which, you should probably get back-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas,” I interrupted him before he could finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t worry about us, we have each other. Go to your wife Eli.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas wait,” I pulled this book out of my jacket pocket. “I’ve been keeping this 
                    account of everything that’s happened to us, Sophia and I, and now that she’s a grozov 
                    and we’ll have to fight Kaiser-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Who said you’ll fight him alone-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No really, Eli. My best friend just killed himself and you want to join him trying 
                    to pull the same arrogant move-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas, listen!” He restrained himself as he scowled at me. “Be honest, she’s the 
                    only one who can stand a chance against him, and you know that. He’d kill the rest 
                    of us with ease-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re all in this together, Eli. It’s not just the two of you now, you-”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucas, listen!” He stopped trying to object after I began to raise my voice. 
                    “Please, if anything happens to us, please, just finish our story.” I placed the 
                    journal back into my jacket pocket as we stared at one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Fine, Eli, sure.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He started towards Noah and William as I went back to Sophia. I knelt on the grass 
                    next to her as I held her hand. Her wound had healed completely. Now here I am. 
                    Feeling nothing, not even a pulse from her.~~~
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can feel her! I can feel her sadness, or she can feel mine. She’s alive! She’s a 
                    demon! She’s opened her eyes now. I can feel her! She can hear these thoughts without 
                    needing to read this. I can hear her thoughts! <em>Eli, stop writing in your retarded 
                        book! Kaiser’s begun his revenge!</em>

                    They did it! Eli and Sophia actually did it (not that I ever doubted them). It’s 
                    just amazing. Eli and Sophia killed Kaiser. Crisis averted. At least some good 
                    has come out of this. Liam’s funeral’s in a few hours. I’m here at the grave early. 
                    I’m not sure why, but it just seemed like a good place to organize my thoughts. 
                    Eli and Sophia are dead - they basically vaporized themselves. I’m not really sure 
                    how much Eli showed me, but I know that they’re both resting easy. Sophia was dead 
                    from the start. We all knew that. We tried to tell them before we took off, back 
                    when we first met them, but they wouldn’t listen. She was so stubborn. I can see 
                    what he liked in her. I’ve never seen anyone else like them. They were just so 
                    together, but they couldn’t be more different. They were always arguing yet always 
                    on the same page. I guess that’s just how the Stanford guys are like. They were 
                    crazy. Even though Liam didn’t survive, I’m sure he’d be overjoyed. He really cared 
                    about them. He was generally reserved about his feelings, but after we met the two 
                    of them he just wouldn’t shut up. He’d always go on about how much fun they were, 
                    and about how much he looked up to them. I told him nearly every minute that we 
                    barely knew them, but it didn’t matter to him. They just had that sort of energy 
                    I guess. It’s a loss to the world that they’re gone, but it was the only thing they 
                    could’ve done I guess. The only thing I don’t really understand is why this book 
                    was so important to Eli. I get that he wrote everything down in it, but I’m still 
                    not sure what his deal was. It’s not like he has anyone to remember him with this. 
                    And now I’m here writing in a journal at a burial site. I’m not sure what they’re 
                    planning. From what I understand we’re supposed to be telling everyone we see that 
                    they were killed while hiking somewhere and wanted to be brought back here. I don’t 
                    really understand how that’s supposed to work though. How exactly were they supposed 
                    to have been killed, and where would they have been hiking that was dangerous enough 
                    for this to happen. Honestly, it sounds like we’re trying to cover up a suicide or 
                    something. Either way it’s not like it’s a big service. Eli told me once that all 
                    four of their parents were dead. They were on some plane or something which crashed 
                    due to engine failure. That was also the reason they both decided to focus on 
                    aerospace engineering. They were pretty good at it too. I’m not sure what they’re 
                    going to do now though. Their bodies are completely destroyed, so they’re basically 
                    burying paste filled boxes. The paste doesn’t even belong to them, but Noah, William, 
                    and I thought that it was a good idea to try to give some closure to the situation. 
                    We’ll look on to that funeral whenever it happens I suppose. It’s not like we’re 
                    going to get invited considering we don’t exist to them. Anyway they’ll be fine. 
                    They had friends from Stanford and this plane place they said they worked at. Liam’s 
                    who I’m worried about. I called ahead to get this grave exhumed. We built a 
                    headstone from some of his things at the cave. I’m not really sure how to 
                    describe it. It’s kind of a spherical object with stuff impressed into its surface. 
                    He’d like it. It’s just been a crazy day. Liam died, Kaiser killed dozens of people, 
                    then two of the best people in the world sacrificed themselves to save millions. 
                    On top of that I have to deal with an entire colony of angry demons and ration 
                    executions. It’s ridiculous. Why me? I didn’t do anything. It’s really Eli who 
                    should become Krappot. They just sort of told me completely randomly. I guess it 
                    makes sense and everything, but I can’t do it. Sophia and Eli could. They should 
                    be the ones who have to deal with this mess, not me. Eli was right, writing 
                    everything down makes things easier. It’s like my problems suddenly exist in a 
                    material, tangible way. Only a few lines. I’ve been stressing out over something 
                    which I just wrote in a few lines. It was crazy. Today was absolutely crazy. In 
                    less than twenty four hours I lost three of the best friends I’ve ever had, and now 
                    I have to be a strong leader for a mob of bloodthirsty demons who were ready to 
                    begin an interspecies assault. It’s not fair. So much happened since this morning. 
                    Eli and Sophia had just gone through their Stanford symbols thing before Liam killed 
                    himself. I just sort of waited there. What was I going to do? The wall behind me 
                    was solid. The wall in front of me was a death trap, and the only people who could 
                    help me had gone through without me. Then the weirdest thing happened. I was leaning 
                    against the cave wall when the door we’d come in through just opened. I turned 
                    around and saw Noah and William petting that thing that we thought had killed them. 
                    The scene still hurts to remember. There was a bright blue light coming from the 
                    entrance to the cave. I pointed to it before I spoke, “Didn’t we enter on a barren, 
                    dirt covered island?” The twins looked back towards the cave’s mouth and nodded as 
                    they petted that thing we’d thought had killed them. They were basically sitting on 
                    top of it. Claws out, scratching it everywhere. It looked like it was having a 
                    seizure because of the way it was shaking. Almost as soon as Noah had gone back to 
                    playing with their pet he looked back at me, “Where are the others?” I think they’d 
                    just assumed that I’d somehow gotten left behind while Liam went with Eli and Sophia 
                    to get the stava. I leaned against the side of the cave and twiddled my fleshy thumbs 
                    for a while before I answered. “Eli and Sophia went to get the stava.” They got off 
                    the animal and stared at me, I think in disbelief. We didn’t say anything after that. 
                    They sat next to me as we all just looked at each other. It was the first time I 
                    had seen them completely dumbfounded. They’d been sad and confused before, but they 
                    always had a plan. They always knew what was going on and what to do. We sat there 
                    until we heard Eli’s voice come out from the cave. It was simultaneously the longest 
                    and shortest moment of my life. We all just sat there and cried. The worst part is 
                    that we still don’t have his body. Since that moment I’ve been thinking about it. 
                    He was right there, right in front of me. I was just so revolted. It cleaved him. 
                    The magic numbers cleaved him cleanly in half. A charred front end and a perfectly 
                    normal tail end. I left him in the cave. His actual body’s as good as buried. For 
                    the funeral we’re all going to get our favorite memories of him. I went back to his 
                    room and found an old die I’d given him. Dad found it once when he was outside the 
                    cave. He told me people used it to come up with a random number, but only between 
                    one and six. I’m not sure why though, what’s the use of a number between one and 
                    six. You’d think that at the very least they’d make it go to one hundred or 
                    something, to make it more universal. I’d “lost” it once while I was taking a nap. 
                    I knew that Liam had seen me playing with it before and that he was just playing a 
                    joke on me, but I told dad that it was stolen and that it was the most valuable 
                    thing I owned. He ordered a cavewide lockdown and search for it, and ordered that 
                    whoever it was found with was to be expelled from the cave. I still remember Liam’s 
                    face when I told him. He instantly pressed his wings against his back and stood 
                    like a soldier in his flesh. I thought that was going to be the end of it, but then 
                    I saw that he’d wet his entire crotch area. It still remains the funniest thing I 
                    have ever seen. I told dad that I’d found it somewhere in my room after that. Liam 
                    never stole anything again, but we couldn’t get him to grow up completely. Since 
                    then he’d constantly pour water under my legs in front of people in the name of 
                    “pay back.” That’s what was so special about him. He could always make light of any 
                    situation, regardless of anything. I’m not sure how I’m supposed to rule without him. 
                    This is completely off topic. Eli told me to tell his story. The three of us flew up 
                    to see Eli covered in burns and Sophia unconconsious. It was horrible. I’m not sure 
                    what exactly was wrong with Sophia, but her shirt seemed stained with something, as 
                    if she had been stabbed, but when Eli looked at it, it was fine. She seemed 
                    invulnerable. Then we all just left. Noah, William, and I kept our distance from 
                    them. Eli was grieving his own, and we didn’t want to bother him. I told him briefly 
                    after he kept pressing me. I wasn’t sure what to do. Now that he’s dead, it would 
                    have been better if he just hadn’t known. He still died easy I guess. The three of 
                    us just sort of crowded around Liam for a while. No one said or thought anything. 
                    I’m not sure exactly how long it’d been, but Eli called to us after a while. Sophia 
                    took off an instant later. I followed them as I told the twins, <em>We’ll come back for 
                    him, don’t worry.</em> As we flew everything seemed bleak. The ocean was a bright blue and 
                    the sun was out, but it was impossible to enjoy any of it. The twins and I flew 
                    alongside one another behind Eli and Sophia, waiting for the ensuing conflict. Soon 
                    we saw Kaiser on top of this building with a woman next to him. He was slowly going 
                    down windows and breaking them, pulling people out and showing them to her before 
                    throwing them from the top of the building. I’m still not sure what the deal with 
                    that is. Kaiser looked like he threw everything at those two. Eli flew across the 
                    sky taking fire from Sophia as she attempted to lash at Kaiser with what looked like 
                    a long, black flame. I tried to fly in to help before Eli’s thoughts found me. <em>Lucas, 
                    it’s not safe here. He will kill you. Get as many people out of here as you can.</em> I 
                    listened, but I still wanted to be with him. I thought out to him, and he listened to 
                    me. Suddenly I was him. I made every move he made, saw everything he saw, and felt 
                    everything he felt. I was standing on the top of the Empire State Building, looking 
                    out ahead of me at Sophia and Kaiser. I couldn’t take it. I couldn’t just stand idly 
                    by while she fought him herself. I took off. Sophia thought out to me the moment I 
                    left the ground. <em>Eli, what are you doing?! You can’t do this and you know it! Leave, 
                    please-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>I can’t leave you alone-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Are you a moron?! I took the joice thing. I’m fine-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Sophia, please!</em> I was pleading. I was pleading with my heart to let me help. 
                    I flew up and saw Sophia. Her majestic figure gleamed and sparkled in the light as she 
                    shifted her color in an attempt to confuse Kaiser. The air on my scales was cold as I 
                    flapped ahead to my wife. As soon as I reached her Kaiser’s cold, meticulous voice 
                    flooded my mind. <em>Listen to you wife little man, go-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked over at Sophia as the voice cut off. She didn’t hide anything from me. My body 
                    writhed in agony as I tried to resist Kaiser’s influence. His imposing, muscled, scaly 
                    figure floated before us as a smile appeared on his face. “What did you think you would 
                    accomplish? Sending your wife to me to be killed? You’re insane, Eli.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sophia dashed forward at him as he stood smiling at me. My head erupted in pain as I 
                    felt immense pressure around it from the strain of keeping Kaiser floating where he was. 
                    Arms clenched around Kaiser, Sophia took off into the sky. I flew up after Sophia as she 
                    and Kaiser kept ascending. <em>Sophia, what-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Eli, go! It’s over-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Sophia, what-</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Leave me now!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A black wing managed to escape Sophia’s grasp, slowing their ascent. “What are you trying 
                    to accomplish with this, Sophia? Did you honestly think you could pull this off?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I couldn’t stand it! How could he talk to her like that?! How could he say that?! I flew up 
                    after them. After Sophia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Eli, please,</em> I cried. I couldn’t stand it. I cried as I looked over to Sophia. I was 
                    doing this. I was hurting her flying up here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Sophia,</em> I expressed the longing, the love I felt. I didn’t want to live without her. 
                    I couldn’t. I stared at her. Into her eyes. Her beautiful, blue, sorrowful eyes. She knew what 
                    I felt before I could even show her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>I can’t live without you too.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hugged her around Kaiser as we flew up together. Soon it got easier. The air got lighter. 
                    Evey stroke took us up higher. Kaiser writhed in pain as he looked at us. White hot pain 
                    erupted through my body as he looked into my eyes. My vision went dark for a moment. When I 
                    could see again I saw Sophia. Kaiser was gone. She showed me the way she’d pushed him out of 
                    the atmosphere. I tried for a moment in vain to flap my wings back to earth before realizing 
                    the futility of my efforts. I looked at her scaly face for a moment. Then I was looking at her 
                    amber hair, blue eyes. It was different this time though. I was looking at her and myself. I 
                    was overrun by love for the both of us, and she felt the same way. I put my hand on her head. 
                    My thumb lightly brushed her cheek as my fingers made their way throughout her weightless hair. 
                    Her light hand tickled my ear before I heard her voice. <em>We did it Eli. We killed him.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Listen,</em> I felt her remorse, the guilt she felt for my presence out here with her. I 
                    showed her what she had said. The words she told me while we were still in the cave, <em>If I die 
                    then it wasn’t your fault, I love you.</em> I looked into her eyes as we both tilted our heads 
                    slightly. We knew what was coming, and we were ready. Her face began to move towards mine-
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was it. That was the end of everything. I looked around me and everything was fine. 
                    There wasn’t even a panic, just mass confusion. The story that was released was that some 
                    brats just pranked everyone and people accepted it. There wasn’t really any harm done 
                    (at least not to them). I’m still not sure how I feel about this. This entire adventure was 
                    Eli’s, this is Eli’s journal, but for some reason I’m here writing in it. Eli’s done. Sophia’s 
                    done. They’re done. I wish I was too. After all of this. Liam, Eli, and Sophia, all I want to 
                    do is go back home and relax, but I can’t. It’s complicated. As soon as Kaiser died I heard a 
                    voice in my head, Be careful coming back here, you’ll have a lot on your plate Krappot Lucas. 
                    It’s ridiculous. Dad had appointed me Krappot just before he died, and everybody knew it, but 
                    I didn’t want it, and I still don’t. It’s ridiculous! Why should I? Why do I need to take care 
                    of hundreds of angry monstars every second of my life. At least I don’t have any blood on my 
                    account. People have already assumed that Kaiser killed Liam on top of the tower. They think 
                    we’ve been out trying to recover intelligence on Eli for the past three days since - Liam, the 
                    twins, and I. It’s stupid. They never cared and they never will. The entire time dad was 
                    Krappot they remained dormant because he asked them to, but after Kaiser I’m not sure if 
                    there’ll be idealists. It’s ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to take care of this. Of everything 
                    and every mess I could be in right now, why this one? Noah and William are coming right now. 
                    It seems like just the three of us are going to bury Liam, then that’ll be it. My life for the 
                    last three days is over. My new world begins tomorrow.
