            Kyrillos Bastawros was born on December 30, 2003, and grew up in Ames, Iowa. He entered 
            high school in 2017 at Gilbert High Shcool, part of the Gilbert Community School District. 
            Excelling in a majority of his classes, he was asked by a couple of his friends to edit an 
            array of short stories they'd written, which sparked a creative endeavor inspired partially 
            from the Dreamworks movie 
            <a class="Button" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001526/" target="blank">Megamind</a>. After finishing
            an initial draft of his piece, he sent it to a few of his friends, who promptly ridiculed it
            for its many flaws. Inspired by their critisms, Kyrillos then reworked his entire piece into
            what it is today. If you would like to share your input or critisms with him he can be
